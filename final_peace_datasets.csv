Voter Registration,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/voter-registration-f2e6b,"This table contains data on the percent of adults (18 years or older) who are registered voters and the percent of adults who voted in general elections, for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Statewide Database, University of California Berkeley Law, and the California Secretary of State, Elections Division. The table is part of a series of indicators in theHealthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity.Political participation can be associated with the health of a community through two possible mechanisms: through the implementation of social policies or as an indirect measure of social capital. Disparities in political participation across socioeconomic groups can influence political outcomes and the resulting policies could have an impact on the opportunities available to the poor to live a healthy life. Lower representation of poorer voters could result in reductions of social programs aimed toward supporting disadvantaged groups. Although there is no direct evidentiary connection between voter registration or participation and health, there is evidence that populations with higher levels of political participation also have greater social capital. Social capital is defined as resources accessed by individuals or groups through social networks that provide a mutual benefit. Several studies have shown a positive association between social capital and lower mortality rates, and higher self- assessed health ratings. There is also evidence of a cycle where lower levels of political participation are associated with poor self-reported health, and poor self-reported health hinders political participation.

National Hydrography Data - NHD and 3DHP,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-0c127,"The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Downloadable Data Collection from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a ""reach code"" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go tohttps://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography.DWR was the steward for NHD and Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in California. We worked with other organizations to edit and improve NHD and WBD, using the business rules for California. California's NHD improvements were sent to USGS for incorporation into the national database. The most up-to-date products are accessible from the USGS website. Please note that the California portion of the National Hydrography Dataset is appropriate for use at the 1:24,000 scale.For additional derivative products and resources, including the major features in geopackage format, please go to this page:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-major-featuresArchives of previous statewide extracts of the NHD going back to 2018 may be found athttps://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-archive.In September 2022, USGS officially notified DWR that the NHD would become static as USGS resources will be devoted to the transition to the new 3D Hydrography Program (3DHP). 3DHP will consist of LiDAR-derived hydrography at a higher resolution than NHD. Upon completion, 3DHP data will be easier to maintain, based on a modern data model and architecture, and better meet the requirements of users that were documented in the Hydrography Requirements and Benefits Study (2016). The initial releases of 3DHP will be the NHD data cross-walked into the 3DHP data model. It will take several years for the 3DHP to be built out for California.

Early Grade Reading Activity Malawi,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/early-grade-reading-activity-malawi,"The Malawi Early Grade Reading Activity (MEGRA) is a multifaceted educational development approach intended to enable sustained literacy among children, promote a literate community, and help the country increase economic growth and reduce poverty. The USAID/Malawi funded program was implemented starting August of 2013, by RTI (Research Triangle Institute) International. The MEGRA educational program was implemented alongside a Feed the Future project called Integrating Nutrition in Value Chains (INVC) and a Global Health Initiative project called Support for Service Delivery Integration (SSDI), both of which were also expected to affect the success of learners in school. Through this interconnected strategy, USAID/Malawi aimed to have a greater impact on outcomes of interest (such as learning reading scores) than would otherwise be possible through one project alone. The key elements of the MEGRA reading intervention involved:•   Conduct teacher training, including practicums
•   Provide scripted lesson plans to teachers
•   Provide in-service teacher support and mentoring (or coaching)
•   Provide rewards for high-performing teachers and schools
•   Develop and distribute books, story cards, letter cards, and bookshelves
•   Organize reading fairs and other events to engage parents, caregivers, and the community in learner learning
•   Invite parents to participate in their learners’ classrooms and/or become engaged in extracurricular activities
•   Ensure a supportive policy environment by attending the Basic Education Technical Working Group and writing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to gain necessary Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology(MoEST) support and buy-in
•   Facilitate the extension of school instructional timeIn order to test possible complementary or multiplier effects of the MEGRA reading intervention and the INVC and SSDI activities, all three interventions were implemented in and evaluated for four distinct treatment levels:
•   Treatment Level 1: Three focus districts (Balaka, Machinga, and Lilongwe Rural) that provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of a fully-integrated development approach with multiple activities across sectors, including MEGRA, INVC, and SSDI, on early grade reading outcomes.
•   Treatment Level 2: The district (Salima) where MEGRA overlaps with only the SSDI intervention. This serves as a test ground for the hypothesis that synergies between education and health initiatives catalyze changes that are greater than the sum of their parts.
•   Treatment Level 3: The district (Ntcheu) where MEGRA overlaps with only the INVC intervention. This serves as a test ground for the development hypothesis that synergies between education and agricultural livelihood and nutrition initiatives catalyze changes that are greater than the sum of their parts.
•   Treatment Level 4: Five districts (Blantyre Rural, Mzimba North, Ntchisi, Thyolo, and Zomba Rural) that only receive the MEGRA initiative. These districts are used to test the MEGRA theory of change that education support leads to improved literacy and general education outcomes.MEGRA was implemented at the zonal level, at baseline in 2013, where zones were randomly selected in each of the four levels to implement the MEGRA intervention (taking into account areas where INVC and SSDI were already working). However, since INVC and SSDI were not randomly assigned at baseline, the evaluation can only be able to determine whether EGRA is better than no EGRA and whether EGRA plus INVC and SSDI is better than no treatment.While MEGRA expected to include both treatment and comparison schools in each district at each level, at baseline, it was unable to because the SSDI and INVC activities were already underway. As such, the program found that in the Level 2 district, Salima, it was impossible to select comparison zones that were not already contaminated with the SSDI intervention because SSDI was already working across the entire di",2024,,,,Open Data,,data.usaid.gov,no-reply@data.usaid.gov,,,,Civic engagement initiatives,,

"Earthquake-Triggered Ground Failure associated with the M7.1 2018 Southcentral, Alaska Earthquake (ver. 2.0, December 2023)",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/earthquake-triggered-ground-failure-associated-with-the-2018-m7-1-southcentral-alaska-eart,"The November 30, 2018, magnitude (Mw) 7.1 Anchorage, Alaska earthquake triggered substantial ground failure throughout Anchorage and surrounding areas (Grant and others, 2020; Jibson and others, 2020). The earthquake was an intraslab event with a focal depth of about 47 km and an epicenter about 16 km north of the city of Anchorage. Peak ground accelerations reached ∼30% g. Despite the relatively low severity of most of the ground failure occurrences, geotechnical damage to buildings and structures was widespread (Franke and others, 2019).
Here, we present an inventory of the earthquake-triggered ground failure based on information compiled from numerous data sources. The inventory is comprised of 886 points that each correspond to the location of earthquake triggered ground failure associated with the 2018 event (Figure 1). For each instance of ground failure, the direct observation is reported and, where possible, is categorized based on the process interpreted to have caused it. For example, an observation of a rock fall would be categorized as a landslide. Similarly, a sand boil would be categorized as evidence of liquefaction. Where possible, the features were more precisely mapped with an additional polygon (n=179) and or line feature (n=32). To determine the existence and location of ground failure features, we relied on a variety of mapping methods and data sources. As such, the certainty in the mapping of each feature within the inventory varies (Figure 2). Details on how uncertainty is reported as well as the methods and data sources used are discussed in the following sections.Data and Methods
The inventory was compiled using a variety of different sources and methods with varying levels of success (Martinez and others, 2021). To convey this, the overall mapping certainty for each feature within the inventory is determined by assigning a semi-quantitative grade for categories related to the certainty of the existence of the feature, the positional accuracy of the mapped feature, and the mapped delineation quality. Those categories are denoted as presence, location, and delineation certainty in the inventory attribute table.  Confidence grade definitions, and all other inventory attributes, are described in Table 1.
As previously mentioned, we relied on a variety of methods and data sources to develop the ground failure inventory. We primarily relied on field observation data and information shared from federal, state, and local agencies. These data sources were particularly helpful where remotely sensed data were not available or insufficient for mapping ground failure. Here, we summarize how remotely sensed data were used and in which ways they were advantageous or insufficient. High resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are typically used to develop high-quality ground failure inventories. We began our ground failure mapping efforts by differencing high resolution pre- and post-earthquake lidar derived DEMs from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (AK DNR)  Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) elevation portal (DGGS Elevation Portal (alaska.gov)). The pre- and post-earthquake DEMs used to identify and map the extent of ground failure in this study had an areal overlap of approximately 321 km2. These data cover only a small portion of the area that experienced moderate to severe shaking during the earthquake (60,690 km2) as estimated from the USGS ShakeMap.In regions lacking sufficient DEM coverage we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) differencing to identify and map ground failure. NDVI maps are derived from multispectral imagery and display the relative health or existence of vegetation in a landscape. For this study, NDVI maps were derived using imagery from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI) (Drusch and others, 2012).  Ground failure that is severe enough to disturb vegetation can be mapped by differencing pre- and post- earthquake NDVI maps. However, efforts to create NDVI maps of the landscape following the earthquake were hindered due to snowfall that began to accumulate shortly after the earthquake (2 December 2018). To overcome this limitation, we used Google Earth Engine (Gorelick and others, 2017) to create composites of multispectral images of the summers (May 1 to July 30) before and after the earthquake instead. The image composites were then used to create NDVI maps that were differenced to determine where there were any significant changes in vegetation that could potentially correspond to ground failure. While the resolution of the data used for the NDVI differencing (10-m) is lower than that used for DEM differencing (1-m) it is advantageous as it is available globally, and thus, for the entire earthquake affected region of Southcentral, Alaska.Despite the advantage of globally available NDVI data, the method is still limited in its ability to detect smaller and more subtle vegetation changes. Our comparisons may also include some landslides that were not triggered by the earthquake but happened in the time spanned by the images. When possible, satellite and aerial imagery alone were also used to map ground failure features. However, in most instances the imagery alone was inadequate for mapping because many features were not visible in available satellite imagery. In addition, the ground surface was obscured in satellite imagery as a result of snow fall that occurred shortly after the earthquake. Some features, such as large road cracks, were not visible following snowmelt as they were quickly repaired by The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. Other ephemeral features, such as sand boils or cracks on tidal flats, were no longer visible in satellite imagery after snowmelt and several tidal cycles.
Remotely sensed data alone were found to be insufficient for mapping ground failure associated with this event (see Martinez and others, 2021). In addition to the limitations of remotely sensed data, the aforementioned snowfall that occurred immediately after the earthquake obscured large swaths of land and subsequently hindered efforts to gather ground failure observations while in the field. Thus, in addition to the remotely sensed data, the inventory was supplemented with field observations gathered by U.S. Geological Survey scientists shortly after the event (Grant and others, 2020), information on earthquake damage supplied from federal (FEMA Region X), state (The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities) and local agencies (Municipality of Anchorage, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Matanuska-Susitna Borough Department of Emergency Services, 673 Civil Engineers Squadron at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage Fire Station 12) as well as compiled social media information and data from literature on the 2018 earthquake event.
Using the data mentioned above, we inferred which ground failure process to assign to each ground failure location based on contextual information such as the environment and presence of evidence that suggests ground failure may have occurred. We assigned the “landslide” process to locations where there are indications of the downhill movement of material. A modified classification scheme based on Keefer (1984) was used to classify the observed landslide features within our inventory (see Table 1 for landslide classification scheme). Evidence that liquefaction processes may have occurred include the presence of ground cracks, sand boils, lateral spreads, the settlement of structures, and rapid soil flows. In cases where direct evidence of liquefaction is lacking (i.e., sand boils), the classification is based on proximity to identified sand boils. Liquefaction was interpreted to be the process for observed lateral spreading features parallel to water bodies. Low-lying features on flat slopes (e.g., settlement alone) for which there is no direct evidence to suggest that liquefaction occurred are given the label “Liquefaction (Ambiguous)” to reflect the uncertain nature in their process designation.Despite the use of supplemental data, the inventory is still considered incomplete, with varying levels of completeness throughout the region. Adverse environmental conditions including snow fall, limited daylight hours, a large earthquake-affected area, and accessibility constraints limited the extent to which both field and remotely sensed observations could be reliably used to compile a ground failure inventory. To communicate this variability in inventory completeness and quality, Figure 2 displays the region, highlighted in white, in which direct observations of ground failure were made in addition to where high-resolution pre- and post-earthquake lidar data are available. This higher-confidence mapping region displays where the inventory is considered complete and high quality due to the nature of the data (i.e., direct observations, high-quality lidar) used for mapping in this region. To minimize human error, two co-authors carefully reviewed the inventory for inconsistencies and errors.Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.

ES80 Water Column Sonar Data Collected During IYSNWExplorer22,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/es80-water-column-sonar-data-collected-during-iysnwexplorer22,"Pacific salmon are an important cultural, commercial, and biological resource for countries of the 
                North Pacific rim. The geographic distribution of these salmon spans the North Pacific Ocean 
                (NPO), where they occupy a variety of ecosystems and water masses throughout their ocean life 
                history phase. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate 
                distribution, productivity/survival in coastal and high seas environments. These gaps hamper our 
                ability to usefully inform management decisions related to fisheries and habitat across 
                freshwater, coastal and high seas ecosystems.
                As a changing climate and associated anomalous events in the large marine ecosystems of the 
                NPO progressively expose Pacific salmon to conditions that are outside the ""normal"" climate 
                cycles, society will confront new resource management issues. These include the future of the 
                cultures and subsistence lifestyles of local Indigenous communities, potential impacts of 
                industrial activities (e.g., commercial fishing), potential changes to regional ocean carrying 
                capacity, and resilience of North Pacific marine ecosystems. In addition, the growing threat of 
                illegal, unreported, and unregulated high seas fishing and the recovery of salmon populations 
                listed under the US Endangered Species Act and Canadian Species at Risk Act has increased the 
                need for timely advice about salmon distribution.
                An international effort is required to detect and monitor changes in salmon and their ecosystem
                because stocks from all major salmon States of origin are distributed in the NPO. Salmon 
                originate in producer nations rivers migrate through the exclusive economic zones of coastal 
                states and intermingle in the high seas. In response to this need, the NPAFC, with partners and 
                collaborating scientists in academia, NGOs and the private sector, is conducting an ambitious 
                high seas research expedition with up to five research vessels surveying the full breadth of the 
                NPO in late winter 2022. The expedition will test a collaborative research framework to better 
                understand the mechanisms and processes that regulate the distribution and abundance of Pacific 
                salmon and steelhead trout; to promote sustainable populations of anadromous populations in the 
                NPO; to allow for better forecasts of salmon production trends in the future; and to enhance the 
                sustainable fisheries management, food security, and economic security in salmon States. 
                Our key methodological approach is to conduct an international survey of salmon and their 
                ecosystems in the offshore regions of the NPO by deploying survey vessels at key times and 
                areas to provide a seasonal picture of the distribution, migration and ecology of salmon in the 
                high seas. This information will be connected to survey data (past and present) from NPAFC 
                member countries conducting integrated ecosystem research within their Exclusive Economic 
                Zones (EEZs) and previous international salmon research in the high seas. Together, these 
                surveys provide a unique opportunity for research towards conservation and management of 
                Pacific salmon.
                This effort builds on decades of high seas trawl surveys by the Russian Federation and other 
                countries in the NPO and successful international research endeavors by the NPAFC and its 
                precursor the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (INPFC), such as the Bering Aleutian Salmon International Survey (BASIS; NPAFC Doc. 579 Rev 2). Two recent winter 
                surveys to the Gulf of Alaska in 2019 and 2020, which were privately organized by Dr. Dick

"Prevalence, Context, and Consequences of Dual Arrest in Intimate Partner Cases in 19 States in the United States, 2000",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/prevalence-context-and-consequences-of-dual-arrest-in-intimate-partner-cases-in-19-states--94dd3,"This project provided the first large-scale examination of the police response to intimate partner violence and of the practice known as ""dual arrest.""  The objectives of the project were: (1) to describe the prevalence and context of dual arrest in the United States, (2) to explain the variance in dual arrest rates throughout the United States, (3) to describe dual arrest within the full range of the police response to intimate partner violence, (4) to analyze the factors associated with no arrest, single arrest, and dual arrest, (5) to examine the reasons why women are arrested in intimate partner cases, and (6) to describe how the criminal justice system treats women who have been arrested for domestic violence.  Data for the project were collected in two phases. In Phase I, researchers examined all assault and intimidation cases in the year 2000 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) database (NATIONAL INCIDENT-BASED REPORTING SYSTEM, 2000 [ICPSR 3449]) to investigate the extent to which dual arrest is occurring nationwide, the relationship between incident and offender characteristics, and the effect of state laws on police handling of these cases for all relationship types. Because the NIBRS dataset contained a limited number of incident-specific variables that helped explain divergent arrest practices, in Phase II, researchers collected more detailed information on a subset of NIBRS cases from 25 police departments of varying sizes across four states. This phase of the study was restricted to intimate partner and other domestic violence cases. Additional data were collected for these cases to evaluate court case outcomes and subsequent re-offending. This phase also included an assessment of how closely department policy reflected state law in a larger sample of agencies within five states. The data in Part 1 (Phase I Data) contain 577,862 records from the NIBRS. This includes information related to domestic violence incidents such as the most serious offense against the victim, the most serious victim injury, the assault type, date of incident, and the counts of offenses, offenders, victims, and arrests for the incident. The data also include information related to the parties involved in the incident including demographics for the victim(s) and arrestee(s) and the relationship between victim(s) and arrestee(s). There is also information related to the jurisdiction in which the incident occurred such as population, urban/rural classification, and whether the jurisdiction is located in a metropolitan area.  There are also variables pertaining to whether a weapon was used, the date of arrest, and the type of arrest.  Also included are variables regarding the police department such as the number of male and female police officers and civilians employed. The data in Part 2 (Phase II Data) contain 4,388 cases and include all of the same variables as those in Part 1. In addition to these variables, there are variables such as whether the offender was on the scene when the police arrived, who reported the incident, the exact nature of injuries suffered by the involved parties, victim and offender substance use, offender demeanor, and presence of children. Also included are variables related to the number of people including police and civilians who were on the scene, the number of people who were questioned, whether there were warrants for the victim(s) or offender(s), whether citations were issued, whether arrests were made, whether any cases were prosecuted, the number of charges filed and against whom, and the sentences for prosecuted cases that resulted in conviction. The data in Part 3 (Police Department Policy Data) contain 282 cases and include variables regarding whether the department had a domestic violence policy, what the department's arrest policy was, whether a police report needed to be made, whether the policy addressed mutual violence, whether the policy instructed how to determine the primary aggressor, and what factors were taken into account in making a decision to arrest. There is also information related to the proportion of arrests involving intimate partners, the proportion of arrests involving other domestics, the proportion of arrests involving acquaintances, and the proportion of arrests involving strangers.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Civilian police reform,,,

"Domestic Terrorism: Assessment of State and Local Preparedness in the United States, 1992",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/domestic-terrorism-assessment-of-state-and-local-preparedness-in-the-united-states-1992-5bfd6,"This project sought to analyze states' and municipalities'
 terrorism preparedness as a means of providing law enforcement with
 information about the prevention and control of terrorist activities
 in the United States. To accomplish this objective, a national survey
 of state and local law enforcement agencies was conducted to assess
 how law enforcement agencies below the federal level perceive the
 threat of terrorism in the United States and to identify potentially
 promising anti- and counter-terrorism programs currently used by these
 jurisdictions. For the purposes of this survey, the researchers used
 the legal definition of terrorism as provided by the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation (FBI), which is ""the unlawful use of force or violence
 against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the
 civilian population, or any segment of either, to further political or
 social objectives."" However, incidents reported by state or local law
 enforcement agencies as potential terrorist incidents often are
 reclassified as ordinary crimes by the FBI if the FBI investigation
 does not reveal evidence that more than one crime was intended to be
 committed or that a network of individuals had prepared to carry out
 additional acts. Since these reported potential terrorist incidents
 may provide important early warnings that an organized terrorism
 effort is emerging, the researchers broadened the official definition
 to include suspected incidents and state and local officials'
 perceptions of crime due to terrorism. Three distinct jurisdictions
 with overlapping responsibilities for terrorism preparedness were
 surveyed in this study: (1) state law enforcement agencies, in most
 cases the state police, (2) organizations with emergency preparedness
 responsibilities and statewide authority but with limited powers of
 law enforcement, and (3) local law enforcement agencies, such as
 municipal police and sheriff departments. Similar questions were asked
 for all three jurisdiction groups. Variables pertaining to the
 organization include questions about contingency plans, guidelines,
 and special police training for dealing with threats of terrorism, the
 amount and types of information and resources exchanged among various
 agencies, and whether the agency had a special terrorism unit and, if
 so, its duties. Variables dealing with threat assessment include
 whether the agency had identified right-wing, left-wing,
 international, ethnic/emigre, or special-issue terrorist groups within
 their jurisdiction and how many incidents were attributed to each
 group. Additional variables provide information on whether the agency
 was involved in investigating any terrorist incidents and the type of
 support received from other agencies for these investigations. The
 risk assessment section of the survey sought information on whether
 the agency had conducted a risk assessment and what potential
 terrorist targets were present in their jurisdiction. Questions in the
 threat environment section cover the respondent's assessment of the
 impact of the Persian Gulf War, the agency's sources of information
 pertaining to terrorism, the likelihood of terrorist attacks on
 various major installations nationally, and the likelihood of a major
 attack in their jurisdiction. Administrative variables include the
 number of sworn officers or professional staff, number of support
 staff, department's budget for the current fiscal year, whether the
 agency received federal funds, and what percentage of the federal
funds were used for anti-terrorism efforts.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Civilian police reform,,,

The goals of this initiative are to (1) create a coordinated community response that ensures just resolution to unsubmitted sexual assault kit (SAK) cases through a victim-centered approach and (2) build jurisdictions' capacity to prevent the development of conditions that lead to high numbers of unsubmitted sexual assault kits. Site efforts to address these issues include agencies such as law enforcement, prosecution, forensic laboratories, and victim advocacy service organizations. Westat was awarded a contract by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to assess components of BJA's Sexual Assault Kit Initiative (SAKI). The study includes (1) an evaluability assessment of 17 sites to determine their readiness for an evaluation, (2) a process evaluation and system reform assessment of the 17 sites, (3) a feasibility assessment of using case level data for an outcome evaluation, and analysis of a subset of unsubmitted SAK cases to identify how characteristics of incidents, offenders, and victims are associated with case processing decisions and outcomes, and (4) development of a long-term outcome evaluation plan.
Two sources of data are archived with NAJCD: (1) coded qualitative data from primarily on-site interviews the Westat Team conducted in 2018 with stakeholders from 17 of the fiscal year (FY) 2015 SAKI grantees and 2 private lab facilities and 2) quantitative case-level data from the 2 FY 2015 SAKI grantees on SAKI cases associated with previously unsubmitted sexual assault kits that were determined to contain foreign DNA or biological evidence through laboratory testing. The interview data file contains coded data from 172 interviews the research team conducted with one or more agency representatives regarding their organization's goals, strategies, and activities for processing sexual assault kits, and associated lessons learned, challenges, and expected outcomes.  The quantitative case-level data file includes case-level information on 576 sexual assault kits determined to have DNA and associated cases included in the 2 sites' SAKI inventories. The case-level data captures information on case or offense-level information (e.g., date of offense, date offense reported to police, number of victims and suspects involved, investigation and prosecution activities), victim-level information (e.g., victim age, sex, race, participation in investigation), and suspect-level information (e.g., suspect's age, race, sex, criminal history).",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Civilian police reform,,,

these laws was conducted in only four states and for a limited time
span following the reform. The purpose of this study was to provide
both increased breadth and depth of information about the effect of
the rape law changes and the legal issues that surround them. Statistical data on all rape cases between 1970
and 1985 in Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia, and
Washington, DC, were collected from court records. Monthly time-series
analyses were used to assess the impact of the reforms on rape
reporting, indictments, convictions, incarcerations, and
sentences. The study also sought to determine if particular changes,
or particular combinations of changes, affected the case processing
and disposition of sexual assault cases and whether the effect of the
reforms varied with the comprehensiveness of the changes. In each
jurisdiction, data were collected on all forcible rape cases for which
an indictment or information was filed. In addition to forcible rape,
other felony sexual assaults that did not involve children were
included. The names and definitions of these crimes varied from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. To compare the pattern of rape reports
with general crime trends, reports of robbery and felony assaults
during the same general time period were also obtained from the
Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) from the Federal Bureau of Investigation
when available. For the adjudicated case data (Parts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
and 11), variables include month and year of offense, indictment,
disposition, four most serious offenses charged, total number of
charges indicted, four most serious conviction charges, total number
of conviction charges, type of disposition, type of sentence, and
maximum jail or prison sentence. The time series data (Parts 2, 4, 6,
8, 10, and 12) provide year and month of indictment, total indictments
for rape only and for all sex offenses, total convictions and
incarcerations for all rape cases in the month, for those on the
original rape charge, for all sex offenses in the month, and for those
on the original sex offense charge, percents for each indictment,
conviction, and incarceration category, the average maximum sentence
for each incarceration category, and total police reports of forcible
rape in the month. Interviews were also conducted in each site with
judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys, and this information is
presented in Part 13. These interviewees were asked to rate the importance
of various types of evidence in sexual assault cases and to respond to
a series of six hypothetical cases in which evidence of the victim's past
sexual history was at issue. Respondents were also presented with a
hypothetical case for which some factors were varied to create 12 different
scenarios, and they were asked to make a set
of judgments about each. Interview
data also include respondent's title, sex, race, age, number of years
in office, and whether the respondent was in office before and/or after the
reform.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Civilian police reform,,,

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except of the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompany readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collections and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.The purpose of the study was to implement a ""platform-based"" methodology for collecting data about police organizations and the communities they serve with the goals of generating in-depth standardized information about police organizations, personnel and practices and to help move policing in the direction of evidence-based ""learning-organizations"" by providing judicious feedback to police agencies and policy makers. The research team conducted three web-based Law Enforcement Organizations (LEO) surveys of sworn and civilian law enforcement employees (LEO Survey A Data, n=22,765; LEO Survey B Data, n=15,825; and LEO Survey C Data, n=16,483). The sample was drawn from the 2007 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) database. Agencies with 100 to 3,000 sworn police personnel were eligible for participation. To collect data for the Police-Community Interaction (PCI) survey (PCI Data, n=16,659), each week department employees extracted names and addresses of persons who had recent contact with a police officer because of a reported crime incident, traffic accident or traffic stop. Typically, the surveys were completed within two to four weeks of the encounter.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Civilian police reform,,,
"Evaluating a Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) Night Drug Court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, 1997-1998",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/evaluating-a-driving-while-intoxicated-dwi-night-drug-court-in-las-cruces-new-mexico-1997--c51c6,"The purpose of this study was twofold. First, researchers
 wanted to assess the benefits of the driving while intoxicated (DWI)
 drug court established in the Las Cruces, New Mexico, Municipal Court
 in an effort to determine its future viability. This was accomplished
 by examining the behaviors and attitudes of three groups of convicted
 drunk-drivers and determining the extent to which these groups were
 different or similar. The three groups included: (1) non-alcoholic
 first- and second-time offenders (non-alcoholic offenders), (2)
 alcoholic first- and second-time DWI offenders (alcoholic offenders),
 and (3) chronic three-time (or more) DWI offenders (chronic
 offenders). The second purpose of this study was to explore police
 officers' attitudes toward court-based treatment programs for DWI
 offenders, while examining the distinguishing characteristics between
 police officers who support court-based programs for drunk drivers and
 those who are less likely to support such sanctions. Data for Part 1,
 Drug Court Survey Data, were collected using a survey questionnaire
 distributed to non-alcoholic, alcoholic, and chronic offenders. Part 1
 variables include blood alcohol level, jail time, total number of
 prior arrests and convictions, the level of support from the
 respondents' family and friends, and whether the respondent thought
 DWI was wrong, could cause injury, or could ruin lives. Respondents
 were also asked whether they acted spontaneously in general, took
 risks, found trouble exciting, ever assaulted anyone, ever destroyed
 property, ever extorted money, ever sold or used drugs, thought lying
 or stealing was OK, ever stole a car, attempted breaking and entering,
 or had been a victim of extortion. Demographic variables for Part 1
 include the age, gender, race, and marital status of each
 respondent. Data for Part 2, Police Officer Survey Data, were
 collected using a survey questionnaire designed to capture what police
 officers knew about the DWI Drug Court, where they learned about it,
 and what factors accounted for their attitudes toward the program.
 Variables for Part 2 include police officers' responses to whether DWI
 court was effective, whether DWI laws were successful, the perceived
 effect of mandatory jail time versus treatment alone, major problems
 seen with DWI policies, if DWI was considered dangerous, and how the
 officer had learned or been briefed about the drug court. Other
 variables include the number of DWI arrests, and whether respondents
 believed that reforms weaken police power, that DWI caused more work
 for them, that citizens have bad attitudes, that the public has too
 many rights, and that stiffer penalties for DWI offenders were more
successful.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Civilian police reform,,,

"National Survey of Investigations in the Community Policing Context, 1997",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-survey-of-investigations-in-the-community-policing-context-1997-b2ff8,"This survey collected descriptive information from
municipal police departments and sheriffs offices across the United
States to determine whether the departments had implemented community
policing, how their investigative functions were organized, and the
ways in which their investigative organizational structure may have
been modified to accommodate a community policing approach. The
research project involved a national mail survey of municipal police
departments and sheriffs offices in all jurisdictions with populations
of more than 50,000 and 100 or more sworn officers. The survey was
mailed in the late fall of 1997. Data contain responses from 405
municipal departments and 196 sheriffs offices. Questionnaires were
similar but were modified depending on whether they were sent to
municipal or sheriffs agencies. Data generated by the questionnaires
provide descriptive information about the agencies, including agency
type, state, size of population served, number of full-time and
part-time sworn and civilian personnel, number of auxiliary and rescue
personnel, number of detectives, whether the sworn personnel were
represented by a bargaining unit, and if the agency was
accredited. Respondents reported whether community policing had been
implemented and, if so, identified various features that described
community policing as it was structured in their agency, including
year implementation began, number of sworn personnel with assignments
that included community policing activities, and if someone was
specifically responsible for overseeing community policing activities
or implementation. Also elicited was information about the
organization of the investigative function, including number of sworn
personnel assigned specifically to the investigative/detective
function, the organizational structure of this function, location and
assignment of investigators or the investigative function,
specialization of detectives/investigators, their pay scale compared
to patrol officers, their relationship with patrol officers, and their
chain-of-command. Finally, respondents reported whether the
investigative structure or function had been modified to accommodate a
community policing approach, and if so, the year the changes were
first implemented.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Civilian police reform,,,

Light Rail Stations,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/light-rail-stations,"Frequent, reliable transit service is the foundation of a transportation system that empowers all travelers and makes Seattle a truly transit-friendly city. A robust transit network is essential if Seattle is to meet its climate goals and address transportation-related inequities. At its most fundamental level, a transit network is made up of transit infrastructure such as bus lanes, transit signals, and bus stops, often arranged in corridors.  The transit service that travels on this infrastructure can be described as a series of routes that connect different parts of a community for a number of hours per day at a certain frequency (the number of trips at a bus stop per hour). SDOT’s vision for the service aspect of the transit network is followed by a vision for transit infrastructure in the sections below. Public input and surveys consistently point to transit frequency as the most critical factor that influences ridership behavior. This fundamental concept directly informs SDOT’s shared vision for a “Frequent Transit Network” (FTN), which builds from the 2016 Transit Master Plan (TMP) and establishes aspirational frequency targets for transit corridors throughout the city. A high-frequency transit network enables people to move through the city with confidence in a timely arrival—and without the need to consult a schedule—throughout the day and every single day of the week. Continual investment in improved transit frequency in Seattle is essential for many reasons:  Post-pandemic transit is likely to remain less commuter-focused and oriented specifically to Downtown Seattle and must adapt to new travel behaviors and patterns. To support everyday trips by transit (not just commutes), people need reliable mobility at all times, such as early mornings, midday, evenings and at night all days of the week, not just at peak times on weekdays.  Transit needs to accommodate work schedules of non-traditional and low-income workers including the times noted above. Transit should be attractive for all types of trips throughout the week, including education, shopping, and recreational trips, as well as cultural gatherings. An excellent transit network is necessary to accommodate the mode shift required to respond to the impacts of climate change in the next decade. Frequent transit reduces wait time, increases reliability, and values the time for existing and future riders. Frequent transit makes transfers more feasible and allows a network of routes to function as a system. A connected network of frequent transit services is also critical to achieve STP climate goals, which require dramatic increases in transit ridership and VMT reduction to support broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation.  High transit frequencies as part of a reliable, all-day service network can create a more equitable transportation system, making it possible for people of all ages, incomes, and abilities to get where they want to go regardless of when or where they need to travel. The Transit Element presents a vision for frequent transit service in Seattle that goes beyond the original Frequent Transit Network (FTN) presented in the 2016 Transit Master Plan.  Refresh Cycle: None, Static.

In the 1994, 2003, 2004, and 2010 seasons, soybean was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. In 2019, soybean was grown on four large, precision weighing lysimeters and their surrounding 4.4 ha fields. The square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with four fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Soybean was grown on different combinations of fields in different years. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1995, 2003, 2004, and 2010 although in 2010 only one irrigation was applied to establish the crop after which it was grown as a dryland crop. Irrigation protocols described as full were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. Irrigation protocols described as deficit typically involved irrigations to establish the crop early in the season, followed by reduced or absent irrigations later in the season (typically in the later winter and spring).
The growth and yield data include plant population density, height, plant row width, leaf area index, growth stage, total above-ground biomass, leaf and stem biomass, head mass (when present), kernel or seed number, and final yield. Data are from replicate samples in the field and non-destructive (except for final harvest) measurements on the weighing lysimeters. In most cases yield data are available from both manual sampling on replicate plots in each field and from machine harvest. Machine harvest yields are commonly smaller than hand harvest yields due to combine losses.
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on soybean ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.

"Violence Against Women:  Developmental Antecedents Among Black, Caucasian, and Hispanic Women in the United States, 1987-1988 and 1992-1994",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-against-women-developmental-antecedents-among-black-caucasian-and-hispanic-w-1992-bb68d,"The aim of this study was to examine the factors related to
different patterns of male violence against women. Employing both
intra-individual and sociocultural perspectives, the project focused
on the relationship between violence against women and previously
established risk factors for intimate partner violence including
stressors related to work, economic status, and role transitions
(e.g., pregnancy), as well as family power dynamics, status
discrepancies, and alcohol use. The following research questions were
addressed: (1) To what extent do Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic
individuals engage in physical violence with their partners? (2) How
are socioeconomic stressors associated with violent relationships
among Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic couples? (3) To what extent are
changes in patterns of physical violence against women associated with
different stages of a relationship (e.g., cohabitation, early
marriage, pregnancy, marriage)? (4) To what extent do culturally
linked attitudes about family structure (family power dynamics)
predict violence among Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic couples? (5) To
what extent do family strengths and support systems contribute to the
cessation of violence among Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic couples?
(6) What is the role of alcohol use in violent relationships among
Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic couples? The data used for this project
came from the first and second waves of the National Survey of
Families and Households (NSFH) conducted by the Center for Demography
and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison [NATIONAL SURVEY OF
FAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLDS: WAVE I, 1987-1988, AND WAVE II, 1992-1994
(ICPSR 6906)]. The NSFH was designed to cover a broad range of family
structures, processes, and relationships with a large enough sample to
permit subgroup analysis. For the purposes of this study, the
analytical sample focused on only those couples who were cohabiting or
married at the time of the first wave of the study and still with the
same person at the time of the second wave (N=3,584). Since the study
design included oversamples of previously understudied groups (i.e.,
Blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans), racial and ethnic comparisons were
possible. In both waves of the NSFH several identical questions were
asked regarding marital conflicts. Both married and cohabiting
respondents were asked how often they used various tactics including
heated arguments and hitting or throwing things at each other to
resolve their conflicts. In addition, respondents were asked if any of
their arguments became physical, how many of their fights resulted in
either the respondent or their partner hitting, shoving, or throwing
things, and if any injuries resulted as a consequence of these
fights. This data collection consists of the SPSS syntax used to
recode variables from the original NSFH dataset. In addition, new
variables, including both composite variables (e.g., self-esteem,
hostility, depression) and husband and wife versions of the variables
(using information from both respondent and partner), were
constructed. New variables were grouped into the following categories:
demographic, personality, alcohol and drug use, relationship stages,
gender role attitudes, division of labor, fairness in household
chores, social support, and isolation. Psychological well-being scales
were created to measure autonomy, positive relations with others,
purpose in life, self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and personal
growth. Additional scales were created to measure relationship
conflict, sex role gender attitudes, personal mastery, alcohol use,
and hostility. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale and the Center for
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were also utilized.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Conflict-focused early warning systems,,,
Upland Vegetation and Soils Monitoring for the Northern Colorado Plateau Network: 2009-2023 - Data Package,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/upland-vegetation-and-soils-monitoring-for-the-northern-colorado-plateau-network-2009-2023,"Uplands are land areas lying above the elevation where flooding generally occurs—areas found beyond riparian zones. Uplands represent the vast majority of land area in the Northern Colorado Plateau Network (NCPN), and include rock outcrops, badlands, shrublands, grasslands, woodlands, and forests. Upland vegetation provides energy to other trophic levels, habitat structure for various organisms, and is a significant component of species diversity. The ability of uplands to retain soil and nutrients, absorb and release water, and buffer high-runoff precipitation events is a major influence on riparian condition. Upland ecosystems are easily disturbed and slow to recover, yet several NCPN units contain relatively undisturbed examples of grasslands and shrublands. Historic land uses include livestock and timber production. More recently, recreational use has increased. To effectively manage uplands, the National Park Service needs to know the impacts of these uses. Uplands monitoring includes measuring soil stability, hydrologic function, biological soil crusts, and plant community characteristics. The NCPN uses a rotating panel survey design to select randomized sampling plots that are visited every 1–2 years, followed by a relatively long interval between revisits (3–6 years). This design minimizes the chances that sensitive, arid-ecosystem plots will be damaged by repeated visits in successive years and is a cost-effective way to estimate the health of upland ecosystems across a large area. While the sampling has largely followed the survey design, there have been minor deviations due to budget fluctuations, weather, and Covid, resulting in fewer plots being sampled than intended in some years. NCPN uplands monitoring is intended to strike a balance between increasing fundamental understanding of these systems and providing managers with early warning of undesirable change. The NCPN monitors upland vegetation and soils at 10 units: Arches National Park, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Cedar Breaks National Monument, Curecanti National Recreation Area, Dinosaur National Monument, Timpanogos Cave National Monument, and Zion National Park.",2024,,,,Open Data,,National Park Service,NRSS_DataStore@nps.gov,,,Conflict-focused early warning systems,,,
Comfort in High-Performance Homes in a Hot-Humid Climate,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/comfort-in-high-performance-homes-in-a-hot-humid-climate,"TO5 2.3.2: Large-Scale Temperature StudyAlthough space-conditioning systems are required to meet standards such as those in the Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) Manual RS (Rutkowski 1997) and the ASHRAE Standard 55 (ASHRAE 2013) comfort criteria, little is known about how space-conditioning systems are actually operating in the field and if these systems are meeting those standards. Unconventional space-conditioning systems may be necessary for low-load homes in the future. It is important to know how current systems are functioning in existing homes and to what temperatures occupants typically set the thermostats in their homes.The U.S. Department of Energy's Building America research team IBACOS set out to find some answers. By using low-cost data loggers and occupant surveys to monitor 37 single-family homes that have standard heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment, the team gained insight into how sensitive occupants are to comfort in their homes relative to the ACCA and ASHRAE standards. This study focused on one climate zone (hot-humid); however, future studies may find differences among occupants- ideas of thermal comfort in other climate zones. Data were collected from installed sensors during a 2-month period from late August 2014 through late October 2014. The final aspect of this project was to review the business metrics associated with builders involved in a comfort and performance guarantee program.The results of this study-taken as an aggregate-show that the homes provided room-to-room temperature differences less than 6 degrees F 95% of the time. Temperature differences were less than 4 degrees F 80% of the time. Some homes showed better or worse performance. On average, two-story homes had a 3.3 degrees F temperature difference between rooms; single-story homes had an average of a 2.2 degrees F temperature difference between rooms. Occupants who did not use programmable thermostats had an average set point of 75 degrees F. Homes in which the thermostats were programmed with a setback schedule showed a median baseline temperature value of 74 degrees F and had a median afternoon setback of 75 degrees F.System runtime was analyzed and showed that the room-to-room temperature uniformity in some homes worsened during an on cycle, whereas the uniformity improved in other homes. That is, when the system was running, some rooms were receiving too much or too little air relative to the rest of the house, and the temperatures in those rooms were moving away from the temperatures of the other rooms in the house.Finally, analysis of the thermostat data shows a wide degree of variability among homes in the study. Interpretation of the measured data suggests that 21 occupants made no regular adjustments to the thermostats in their homes, seven had regular setbacks, seven showed varying setbacks, and 10 appeared to follow no pattern (with random adjustments).Ultimately, the data show that current systems are maintaining expected levels of comfort. As expected, it is more challenging to maintain a uniform temperature in all rooms of two-story homes, and future systems should address this issue. Furthermore, the data show that the majority of homes maintained relative humidity levels below 60% without any supplemental dehumidification",2023,,,,Open Data,,Ibacos Innovation,apoerschke@ibacos.com,,,Conflict-focused early warning systems,,,
Frequent Transit Network,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/frequent-transit-network,"Frequent, reliable transit service is the foundation of a transportation system that empowers all travelers and makes Seattle a truly transit-friendly city. A robust transit network is essential if Seattle is to meet its climate goals and address transportation-related inequities. At its most fundamental level, a transit network is made up of transit infrastructure such as bus lanes, transit signals, and bus stops, often arranged in corridors.  The transit service that travels on this infrastructure can be described as a series of routes that connect different parts of a community for a number of hours per day at a certain frequency (the number of trips at a bus stop per hour). SDOT’s vision for the service aspect of the transit network is followed by a vision for transit infrastructure in the sections below. Public input and surveys consistently point to transit frequency as the most critical factor that influences ridership behavior. This fundamental concept directly informs SDOT’s shared vision for a “Frequent Transit Network” (FTN), which builds from the 2016 Transit Master Plan (TMP) and establishes aspirational frequency targets for transit corridors throughout the city. A high-frequency transit network enables people to move through the city with confidence in a timely arrival—and without the need to consult a schedule—throughout the day and every single day of the week. Continual investment in improved transit frequency in Seattle is essential for many reasons:  Post-pandemic transit is likely to remain less commuter-focused and oriented specifically to Downtown Seattle and must adapt to new travel behaviors and patterns. To support everyday trips by transit (not just commutes), people need reliable mobility at all times, such as early mornings, midday, evenings and at night all days of the week, not just at peak times on weekdays.  Transit needs to accommodate work schedules of non-traditional and low-income workers including the times noted above. Transit should be attractive for all types of trips throughout the week, including education, shopping, and recreational trips, as well as cultural gatherings. An excellent transit network is necessary to accommodate the mode shift required to respond to the impacts of climate change in the next decade. Frequent transit reduces wait time, increases reliability, and values the time for existing and future riders. Frequent transit makes transfers more feasible and allows a network of routes to function as a system. A connected network of frequent transit services is also critical to achieve STP climate goals, which require dramatic increases in transit ridership and VMT reduction to support broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation.  High transit frequencies as part of a reliable, all-day service network can create a more equitable transportation system, making it possible for people of all ages, incomes, and abilities to get where they want to go regardless of when or where they need to travel. The Transit Element presents a vision for frequent transit service in Seattle that goes beyond the original Frequent Transit Network (FTN) presented in the 2016 Transit Master Plan.  Refresh Cycle: None, Static.

Explore the co-occurrence of bias motivated victimization with other forms of victimization.
Measure reporting and help-seeking behaviors of individuals who experience bias motivated victimization.
Identify cultural factors which may contribute to the risk of bias victimization.
Evaluate the effect of bias victimization on negative psychosocial outcomes relative to other forms of victimization.The study's sample was a community sample of 910 respondents which included male and female Latino adults across three metropolitan areas within the conterminous United States. These respondents completed the survey in one of two ways. One set of respondents completed the survey on a tablet with the help of the research team, while the other group self-administered the survey on their own mobile device. The method used to complete the survey was randomly selected. A third option (paper and pencil with an administrator) was initially included but was removed early in the survey's deployment. The survey was administered from May 2018 to March 2019 in the respondent's preferred language (English or Spanish). 
This collection contains 1,620 variables, and includes derived variables for several scales used in the questionnaire. Bias victimization measures considered both hate crimes (e.g. physical assault) and non-criminal bias events (e.g. racial slurs) and allowed the respondent to report multiple incidents, perpetrators, and types of bias victimization. The respondents were asked about their help-seeking and reporting behaviors for the experience of bias victimization they considered to be the most severe and the measures considered both formal (e.g. contacting the police) and informal (e.g. communicating with family) help-seeking behaviors. The victimization scale measured exposure to traumatic events (e.g. witnessing a murder) as well as experiences of victimization (e.g. physical assault). Acculturation and enculturation scales measured topics such as the respondent's use of Spanish and English and their consumption of media in both languages. The variables pertaining to acculturative stress considered factors such as feelings of social isolation, experiences of racism, and conflict with family members.

Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2006),https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2006,"The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED) visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.
DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.
The DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.",2023,,,,Open Data,,Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration,samhda-support@samhsa.hhs.gov,,,Conflict-focused early warning systems,,,

(2023) which presents a framework for incorporating earthquake magnitude estimates based on real-time Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data into the ShakeAlert® earthquake early warning system for the west coast of the United States. Murray et al. (2023) assess the impact of time-dependent noise in GNSS real-time position estimates on the reliability of earthquake magnitudes estimated using such data. To do so they derived peak ground displacement (PGD) estimates from time series of background noise in GNSS real-time positions. These noise-only PGD measurements were used as input to a published empirical relationship to compute magnitude for hypothetical earthquakes that are each defined by an epicentral location and origin time. The data files provided here give the locations of GNSS stations used in the study, the hypothetical epicenters and origin times, and the PGD for each GNSS station for four time windows following each hypothetical origin time. We also provide the epicenters and origin times used to simulate the impact of noisy PGD data in terms of the annual number of spuriously large magnitude estimates that would be generated in the geographic region spanned by California, Oregon, and Washington, United States, due to noise alone. Finally, we include the estimated magnitudes for the annual simulations along with the number of GNSS stations for which the measured PGD exceeding a threshold value that was defined empirically to eliminate unreliable magnitude estimates.",2024,,,,Open Data,,U.S. Geological Survey,jrmurray@usgs.gov,,,Conflict-focused early warning systems,,,

Evidence-based strategies that have been recently developed focus on shifting schools to a more proactive and positive approach by detecting warning signs and intervening early. This project evaluates the implementation of an evidence-based intervention to improve students' mindsets and feelings of school belonging. This grant-funded project was designed to enhance school capacity to implement a Tier 2 intervention, Student Engagement and Empowerment (SEE), to improve student attendance, behavior, and achievement, while simultaneously evaluating the effects of this intervention.

The originally proposed research procedures consisted of an evaluation of the effects of the SEE program on the outcomes of students at elevated risk for disciplinary action and school dropout. Outcome data was collected for at-risk students in classrooms delivering the SEE program, and a comparison sample of at-risk students in classrooms not delivering the SEE program.

"Volcanic hazard boundaries from the volcanic hazard assessment of Medicine Lake volcano, California",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/volcanic-hazard-boundaries-from-the-volcanic-hazard-assessment-of-medicine-lake-volcano-ca,"Medicine Lake volcano (MLV) is a very large shield-shaped volcano located in northern California where it forms part of the southern Cascade Range of volcanoes. It has erupted hundreds of times during its half-million-year history, including nine times during the past 5,200 years, most recently 950 years ago. This record represents one of the highest eruptive frequencies among Cascade volcanoes and includes a wide variety of different types of lava flows and at least two explosive eruptions that produced widespread fallout. Compared to those of a typical Cascade stratovolcano, eruptive vents at MLV are widely distributed, extending 55 km north-south and 40 km east-west. The total area covered by MLV lavas is >2,000 square kilometers, about 10 times the area of Mount St. Helens, Washington. Judging from its long eruptive history and its frequent eruptions in recent geologic time, MLV will erupt again. Although the probability of an eruption is very small in the next year (one chance in 3,600), the consequences of some types of possible eruptions could be severe. Furthermore, the documented episodic behavior of the volcano indicates that once it becomes active, the volcano could continue to erupt for decades, or even erupt intermittently for centuries, and very likely from multiple vents scattered across the edifice.
Owing to its frequent eruptions, explosive nature, and proximity to regional infrastructure, MLV has been designated a “high threat volcano” by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Volcano Early Warning System assessment. Volcanic eruptions are typically preceded by seismic activity, but with only two seismometers located high on the volcano and no other USGS monitoring equipment in place, MLV is at present among the most poorly monitored Cascade volcanoes.",2024,,,,Open Data,,U.S. Geological Survey,jrobins@usgs.gov,,,Conflict-focused early warning systems,,,

 social objectives."" However, incidents reported by state or local law
 enforcement agencies as potential terrorist incidents often are
 reclassified as ordinary crimes by the FBI if the FBI investigation
 does not reveal evidence that more than one crime was intended to be
 committed or that a network of individuals had prepared to carry out
 additional acts. Since these reported potential terrorist incidents
 may provide important early warnings that an organized terrorism
 effort is emerging, the researchers broadened the official definition
 to include suspected incidents and state and local officials'
 perceptions of crime due to terrorism. Three distinct jurisdictions
 with overlapping responsibilities for terrorism preparedness were
 surveyed in this study: (1) state law enforcement agencies, in most
 cases the state police, (2) organizations with emergency preparedness
 responsibilities and statewide authority but with limited powers of
 law enforcement, and (3) local law enforcement agencies, such as
 municipal police and sheriff departments. Similar questions were asked
 for all three jurisdiction groups. Variables pertaining to the
 organization include questions about contingency plans, guidelines,
 and special police training for dealing with threats of terrorism, the
 amount and types of information and resources exchanged among various
 agencies, and whether the agency had a special terrorism unit and, if
 so, its duties. Variables dealing with threat assessment include
 whether the agency had identified right-wing, left-wing,
 international, ethnic/emigre, or special-issue terrorist groups within
 their jurisdiction and how many incidents were attributed to each
 group. Additional variables provide information on whether the agency
 was involved in investigating any terrorist incidents and the type of
 support received from other agencies for these investigations. The
 risk assessment section of the survey sought information on whether
 the agency had conducted a risk assessment and what potential
 terrorist targets were present in their jurisdiction. Questions in the
 threat environment section cover the respondent's assessment of the
 impact of the Persian Gulf War, the agency's sources of information
 pertaining to terrorism, the likelihood of terrorist attacks on
 various major installations nationally, and the likelihood of a major
 attack in their jurisdiction. Administrative variables include the
 number of sworn officers or professional staff, number of support
 staff, department's budget for the current fiscal year, whether the
 agency received federal funds, and what percentage of the federal
funds were used for anti-terrorism efforts.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,Conflict-focused early warning systems,,,

Violence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-reduction-victim-demographics-aggregated,"This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January – March, April – June, July – September, October – December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.This dataset includes a "" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I "" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (""Y""), No (""N""), or Unknown (""UKNOWN."") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the ""shooting"" column will read either ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as “Y.” Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with ""UNKNOWN"" in the shooting column.The dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.How does this dataset classify victims?The methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:Homicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.To determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset.For a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery.

Scores are calculated and placed on a scale ranging from 0 (extremely low risk) to 500 (extremely high risk).Based on this time frame’s version of the Strategic Subject Algorithm, individuals with criminal records are ranked using eight attributes, not including race or sex. These attributes are: number of times being the victim of a shooting incident, age during the latest arrest, number of times being the victim of aggravated battery or assault, number of prior arrests for violent offenses, gang affiliation, number of prior narcotic arrests, trend in recent criminal activity and number of prior unlawful use of weapon arrests.Please note that this data set includes fields that are not used to calculate SSL, for example, neither race nor sex are used in the Strategic Subject Algorithm.

"Dynamic, Graph-Based Risk Assessments for the Detection of Violent Extremist Radicalization Trajectories Using Large Scale Social and Behavioral Data, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, 1994-2020",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dynamic-graph-based-risk-assessments-for-the-detection-of-violent-extremist-radicaliz-1994-36a53,"This project examines the trajectory of radicalization of jihadists and Incels with two broad objectives in mind. First, to develop new integrated computational technology that can mine, monitor, and screen for the occurrence of behaviors associated with dangerously escalating extremism in large heterogenous databases and provide early warnings of individuals or groups on behavioral trajectories toward extremist violence. Second, to harness data science methodologies to enable rapid, semi-automated support for law enforcement analysts and social science researchers to produce structured behavioral indicator profiles from text sources.
The study operated from the premise that being that violent extremists are a rare, complex phenomenon, it is futile to search for a profile of extremism. Rather, it is better to focus on explaining how people come to embrace violent extremism. This path, referred to here as a radicalization trajectory, implies that an arc exists leading the perpetrator from entertaining extremist ideas to action, and that there is a somewhat predictable pathway from a normal, if perhaps angry state, to the perpetration of a violent attack in the name of the ideology. Two teams were combined to analyze radicalization trajectories: data collection and analysis led by Brandeis University and technology development led by Colorado State University (CSU).
The questions revolving around the technological development were as follows: Can tools that rigorously examine and account for the activities of close associates better predict the likelihood that an individual would engage in violent extremism? Which risk assessment indicators for violent extremism in the extant literature are detectable via automated or semi-automated technologies, and what databases and datasets must be integrated to facilitate this detection? Can computationally efficient tools be used to mine these databases for the specific purposes of monitoring and screening for individuals and small groups posing a significant risk for violence?

The Empirical Assessment of Domestic Radicalization (EADR) project seeks to provide practitioners, researchers, and the public with an empirical foundation for understanding the radicalization processes of United States-based extremists. Project researchers utilized a mixed-method, nested approach to explore a number of key research questions related to radicalization, including:what are the demographic, background, and radicalization differences between and within the different ideological milieus?
are there important contextual, personal, ideological, or experiential differences between radicals who commit violent acts and those who do not?
is it possible to identify sufficient pathways to violent extremism?
are the causal mechanisms highlighted by extant theories of radicalization supported by empirical evidence?To address these questions, EADR researchers built the largest known database on individual radicalization in the United States: Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (PIRUS). The database includes 147 variables covering demographic, background, group affiliation, and ideological information for a sample of 1,473 violent and non-violent extremists who radicalized in the United States from 1948-2014.

Many of the densely populated areas along the East Coast (i.e. Long Island, New York) are served by OWDS. Approximately 75 percent of Suffolk County, New York, residents rely on simple OWDS such as a series of cesspools (ground pits lined with cement blocks or rings without a sealed bottom) and septic systems. Cesspools provide minimal wastewater treatment, typically relying on bacteria to breakdown the solid waste while untreated water percolates into the sandy surficial aquifer. The high hydraulic conductivity of the sandy surficial aquifer of the New York coastal region makes these areas particularly vulnerable to organic wastewater contamination. Groundwater samples were collected from the shallow groundwater flow system along the shoreline of (1) a barrier island summer community and (2) the mainland of Long Island. Both locations are distinctive coastal communities in Suffolk County, NY, and typically rely on a simple OWDS system. The coastal communities selected are in areas inundated by the storm tide brought on by Hurricane Sandy and are considered vulnerable to extreme storms (i.e. hurricanes and nor’easters), flooding events, and sea-level rise; all of which can damage wastewater infrastructure and lead to biogeochemical changes that disrupt the level of onsite treatment and result in increased discharge of contaminants to estuaries through groundwater seepage. Specific locations were selected in areas along the shore that are within 180 m downgradient from OWDS and just above the reaches of the spring high-tide mark along the shoreline. For our study, beach areas without bulkheads (a retaining wall built for shoreline protection) were targeted due to the need to access areas downgradient of OWDS. 
Twenty-nine of the 103 pharmaceuticals measured were detected at least once at the NY sample locations. Other detected CECs include PCDUs (caffeine, nicotine, and metabolites), methyl-1<i>H</i>-benzotrizole (a corrosion inhibitor), and piperonyl butoxide (a pesticide synergist).

Native format consists of an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W and 24-bit band-interleaved-by-pixel (BIP) for color. DOQs in native format are cast to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and referenced to either the North American Datum (NAD) of 1927 (NAD27) or the NAD of 1983 (NAD83). GeoTIFF format consists of a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), with all geographic referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W quarter quad is 40-45 megabytes, and a color file is generally 140-150 megabytes. Quarter-quad DOQs are distributed via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) as uncompressed files.7.5-minute (full-quad) DOQs cover an area measuring 7.5-minutes longitude by 7.5-minutes latitude. Full-quad DOQs are mostly available for Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Limited coverage may also be available for other states. Full-quad DOQs are available in both Native and GeoTIFF formats. Native is formatted with an ASCII keyword header followed by a series of 8-bit binary image lines for B/W. DOQs in native format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to either NAD27 or NAD83. GeoTIFF is a georeferenced Tagged Image File Format with referencing information embedded within the .tif file. DOQs in GeoTIFF format are cast to the UTM projection and referenced to NAD83. The average file size of a B/W full quad is 140-150 megabytes. Full-quad DOQs are distributed via FTP as uncompressed files.Seamless DOQs are available for free download from the Seamless site.

This study was designed to determine the nature, incidence, and coincidence of forms of interpersonal conflict and resulting conflict management styles, including physical violence, in an existing nationally-representative cohort of 18 to 32 year old adults between the years 2016 to 2018. Respondent reports of conflicts involving aggressive and violent behavior were distinguished for three relationship categories: intimate partner relationships, friends/acquaintances, and relatively unknown persons/strangers.
The research design covered questions about the nature and frequency of conflicts experienced irrespective of whether the incidents ended violently; conflict management style/tendencies (remedial actions, apologies, accounts); and differences between conflicts that turn violent and those that do not. Additional questions covered include the frequency of violence during the course of disputes, including experiences with physical victimization and the perpetration of violent acts was assessed.
Also elements that facilitate conflict escalation that are deemed important theoretical constructs in research on aggression, such as adverse childhood events, low self-control, negative affect, street code attitudes, routine activities/lifestyles, agreeableness, and alcohol and drug use, in addition to demographic and other person-level variables were investigated.iCOR.Wave1.PRIME.sav (269 variables, 2284 cases)

 broad-based multifaceted violence prevention programs versus programs
 that have a more limited focus. Two specific programs were evaluated
 in four New York City middle schools. The more limited program used
 Project S.T.O.P.(Students Teaching Options for Peace), a conflict
 resolution and peer mediation training program. The full
 multi-faceted program combined Project S.T.O.P. with Safe Harbor, a
 program that provided victimization counseling and taught violence
 prevention. The effects of this combined program, offered in three of
 the middle schools, were compared to those of just the Project
 S.T.O.P. program alone in one middle school. To study the program
 models, researchers used a quasi-experimental pre-post design, with
 nonequivalent comparison groups. Questionnaires were given to students
 to assess the impact of the two programs. Students were asked about
 their knowledge and use of prevention programs in their schools. Data
 were also collected on students' history of victimization, such as
 whether they were ever attacked at school, stolen from, mugged, or
 threatened with a weapon. Students were also asked about their
 attitudes toward verbal abuse, victims of violence, and conditions
 when revenge is acceptable, and their exposure to violence, including
 whether they knew anyone who was sexually abused, beaten, or attacked
 because of race, gender, or sexual orientation. Additional questions
 covered students' use of aggressive behaviors, such as whether they
 had threatened someone with a weapon or had beaten, slapped, hit, or
 kicked someone. Data were also gathered on the accessibility of

Third Generation Simulation Data (TGSIM) I-395 Trajectories,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/third-generation-simulation-data-tgsim-i-395-trajectories,"The main dataset is a 232 MB file of trajectory data (I395-final.csv) that contains position, speed, and acceleration data for non-automated passenger cars, trucks, buses, and automated vehicles on an expressway within an urban environment. Supporting files include an aerial reference image (I395_ref_image.png) and a list of polygon boundaries (I395_boundaries.csv) and associated images (I395_lane-1, I395_lane-2, …, I395_lane-6) stored in a folder titled “Annotation on Regions.zip” to map physical roadway segments to the numerical lane IDs referenced in the trajectory dataset. In the boundary file, columns “x1” to “x5” represent the horizontal pixel values in the reference image, with “x1” being the leftmost boundary line and “x5” being the rightmost boundary line, while the column ""y"" represents corresponding vertical pixel values. The origin point of the reference image is located at the top left corner. The dataset defines five lanes with five boundaries. Lane -6 corresponds to the area to the left of “x1”. Lane -5 corresponds to the area between “x1” and “x2”, and so forth to the rightmost lane, which is defined by the area to the right of “x5” (Lane -2). Lane -1 refers to vehicles that go onto the shoulder of the merging lane (Lane -2), which are manually separated by watching the videos.This dataset was collected as part of the Third Generation Simulation Data (TGSIM): A Closer Look at the Impacts of Automated Driving Systems on Human Behavior project. During the project, six trajectory datasets capable of characterizing human-automated vehicle interactions under a diverse set of scenarios in highway and city environments were collected and processed. For more information, see the project report found here:https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/74647. This dataset, which was one of the six collected as part of the TGSIM project, contains data collected from six 4K cameras mounted on tripods, positioned on three overpasses along I-395 in Washington, D.C. The cameras captured distinct segments of the highway, and their combined overlapping and non-overlapping footage resulted in a continuous trajectory for the entire section covering 0.5 km. This section covers a major weaving/mandatory lane-changing between L'Enfant Plaza and 4th Street SW, with three lanes in the eastbound direction and a major on-ramp on the left side. In addition to the on-ramp, the section covers an off-ramp on the right side. The expressway includes one diverging lane at the beginning of the section on the right side and one merging lane in the middle of the section on the left side. For the purposes of data extraction, the shoulder of the merging lane is also considered a travel lane since some vehicles illegally use it as an extended on-ramp to pass other drivers (see I395_ref_image.png for details). The cameras captured continuous footage during the morning rush hour (8:30 AM-10:30 AM ET) on a sunny day. During this period, vehicles equipped with SAE Level 2 automation were deployed to travel through the designated section to capture the impact of SAE Level 2-equipped vehicles on adjacent vehicles and their behavior in congested areas, particularly in complex merging sections. These vehicles are indicated in the dataset.As part of this dataset, the following files were provided:

"Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE) in Australia, 1995-1999",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/reintegrative-shaming-experiments-rise-in-australia-1995-1999-1f841,"The Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE) project
compared the effects of standard court processing with the effects of
a restorative justice intervention known as conferencing for four
kinds of cases: drunk driving (over .08 blood alcohol content) at any
age, juvenile property offending with personal victims, juvenile
shoplifting offenses detected by store security officers, and youth
violent crimes (under age 30). Reintegrative shaming theory underpins
the conferencing alternative. It entails offenders facing those harmed
by their actions in the presence of family and friends whose opinions
they care about, discussing their wrongdoing, and making repayment to
society and to their victims for the costs of their crimes, both
material and emotional. These conferences were facilitated by police
officers and usually took around 90 minutes, compared with around ten
minutes for court processing time. The researchers sought to test the
hypotheses that (1) there would be less repeat offending after a
conference than after a court treatment, (2) victims would be more
satisfied with conferences than with court, (3) both offenders and
victims would find conferences to be fairer than court, and (4) the
public costs of providing a conference would be no greater than, and
perhaps less than, the costs of processing offenders in court. This
study contains data from ongoing experiments comparing the effects of
court versus diversionary conferences for a select group of
offenders. Part 1, Administrative Data for All Cases, consists of data
from reports by police officers. These data include information on the
offender's attitude, the police station and officer that referred the
case, blood alcohol content level (drunk driving only), offense type,
and RISE assigned treatment. Parts 2-5 are data from observations by
trained RISE research staff of court and conference treatments to
which offenders had been randomly assigned. Variables for Parts 2-5
include duration of the court or conference, if there was any violence
or threat of violence in the court or conference, supports that the
offender and victim had, how much reintegrative shaming was expressed,
the extent to which the offender accepted guilt, if and in what form
the offender apologized (e.g., verbal, handshake, hug, kiss), how
defiant or sullen the offender was, how much the offender contributed
to the outcome, what the outcome was (e.g., dismissed, imprisonment,
fine, community service, bail release, driving license cancelled,
counseling program), and what the outcome reflected (punishment,
repaying community, repaying victims, preventing future offense,
restoration). Data for Parts 6 and 7, Year 0 Survey Data from
Non-Drunk-Driving Offenders Assigned to Court and Conferences and Year
0 Survey Data from Drunk-Driving Offenders Assigned to Court and
Conferences, were taken from interviews with offenders by trained RISE
interview staff after the court or conference proceedings. Variables
for Parts 6 and 7 include how much the court or conference respected
the respondent's rights, how much influence the respondent had over
the agreement, the outcome that the respondent received, if the court
or conference solved any problems, if police explained that the
respondent had the right to refuse the court or conference, if the
respondent was consulted about whom to invite to court or conference,
how the respondent was treated, and if the respondent's respect for
the justice system had gone up or down as a result of the court or
conference. Additional variables focused on how nervous the respondent
was about attending the court or conference, how severe the respondent
felt the outcome was, how severe the respondent thought the punishment
would be if he/she were caught again, if the respondent thought the
court or conference would prevent him/her from breaking the law, if
the respondent was bitter about the way he/she was treated, if the
respondent understood what was going on in the court or conference, if
the court or conference took account of what the respondent said, if
the respondent felt pushed around by people with more power, if the
respondent felt disadvantaged because of race, sex, age, or income,
how police treated the respondent when arrested, if the respondent
regretted what he/she did, if the respondent felt ashamed of what
he/she did, what his/her family, friends, and other people thought of
what the respondent did, and if the respondent had used drugs or
alcohol the past year. Demographic variables in this data collection
include offender's country of birth, gender, race, education, income,
and employment.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,,Justice and human rights support,,

Statewide Crop Mapping,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/statewide-crop-mapping-5fcda,"For many years, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has collected land use data throughout the state and used this information to develop water use estimates for statewide and regional planning efforts, including water use projections, water use efficiency evaluation, groundwater model development, and water transfers. These data are essential for regional analysis and decision making, which has become increasingly important as DWR and other state agencies seek to address resource management issues, regulatory compliance issues, environmental impacts, ecosystem services, urban and economic development, and other issues. Increased availability of digital satellite imagery, aerial photography and new analytical tools make remote sensing based land use surveys possible at a field scale that is comparable to that of DWR’s historical on the ground field surveys. Current technologies allow accurate, large-scale crop and land use identification to be performed at desired time increments, and make possible more frequent and comprehensive statewide land use information. Responding to this need, DWR sought expertise and support for identifying crop types and other land uses and quantifying crop acreages statewide using remotely sensed imagery and associated analytical techniques. Currently, Statewide Crop Maps are available for the Water Years 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and PROVISIONALLY for 2022.Historic County Land Use Surveys spanning 1986 - 2015 may also be accessed using the CADWR Land Use Data Viewer:https://gis.water.ca.gov/app/CADWRLandUseViewer.For Regional Land Use Surveys follow:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/region-land-use-surveys.For County Land Use Surveys follow:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/county-land-use-surveys.",2024,,,,Open Data,,California Department of Water Resources,Landuse@water.ca.gov,,,,Justice and human rights support,,

"Domestic Terrorism: Assessment of State and Local Preparedness in the United States, 1992",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/domestic-terrorism-assessment-of-state-and-local-preparedness-in-the-united-states-1992-5bfd6,"This project sought to analyze states' and municipalities'
 terrorism preparedness as a means of providing law enforcement with
 information about the prevention and control of terrorist activities
 in the United States. To accomplish this objective, a national survey
 of state and local law enforcement agencies was conducted to assess
 how law enforcement agencies below the federal level perceive the
 threat of terrorism in the United States and to identify potentially
 promising anti- and counter-terrorism programs currently used by these
 jurisdictions. For the purposes of this survey, the researchers used
 the legal definition of terrorism as provided by the Federal Bureau of
 Investigation (FBI), which is ""the unlawful use of force or violence
 against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the
 civilian population, or any segment of either, to further political or
 social objectives."" However, incidents reported by state or local law
 enforcement agencies as potential terrorist incidents often are
 reclassified as ordinary crimes by the FBI if the FBI investigation
 does not reveal evidence that more than one crime was intended to be
 committed or that a network of individuals had prepared to carry out
 additional acts. Since these reported potential terrorist incidents
 may provide important early warnings that an organized terrorism
 effort is emerging, the researchers broadened the official definition
 to include suspected incidents and state and local officials'
 perceptions of crime due to terrorism. Three distinct jurisdictions
 with overlapping responsibilities for terrorism preparedness were
 surveyed in this study: (1) state law enforcement agencies, in most
 cases the state police, (2) organizations with emergency preparedness
 responsibilities and statewide authority but with limited powers of
 law enforcement, and (3) local law enforcement agencies, such as
 municipal police and sheriff departments. Similar questions were asked
 for all three jurisdiction groups. Variables pertaining to the
 organization include questions about contingency plans, guidelines,
 and special police training for dealing with threats of terrorism, the
 amount and types of information and resources exchanged among various
 agencies, and whether the agency had a special terrorism unit and, if
 so, its duties. Variables dealing with threat assessment include
 whether the agency had identified right-wing, left-wing,
 international, ethnic/emigre, or special-issue terrorist groups within
 their jurisdiction and how many incidents were attributed to each
 group. Additional variables provide information on whether the agency
 was involved in investigating any terrorist incidents and the type of
 support received from other agencies for these investigations. The
 risk assessment section of the survey sought information on whether
 the agency had conducted a risk assessment and what potential
 terrorist targets were present in their jurisdiction. Questions in the
 threat environment section cover the respondent's assessment of the
 impact of the Persian Gulf War, the agency's sources of information
 pertaining to terrorism, the likelihood of terrorist attacks on
 various major installations nationally, and the likelihood of a major
 attack in their jurisdiction. Administrative variables include the
 number of sworn officers or professional staff, number of support
 staff, department's budget for the current fiscal year, whether the
 agency received federal funds, and what percentage of the federal
funds were used for anti-terrorism efforts.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,,,,Justice and human rights support,,

The National Artificial Intelligence Research And Development Strategic Plan,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/the-national-artificial-intelligence-research-and-development-strategic-plan,"Executive Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that holds promise for tremendous societal and economic benefit. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live, work, learn, discover, and communicate. AI research can further our national priorities, including increased economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of life, and enhanced national and homeland security. Because of these potential benefits, the U.S. government has invested in AI research for many years. Yet, as with any significant technology in which the Federal government has interest, there are not only tremendous opportunities but also a number of considerations that must be taken into account in guiding the overall direction of Federally-funded R&D in AI. On May 3, 2016,the Administration announced the formation of a new NSTC Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, to help coordinate Federal activity in AI.1 This Subcommittee, on June 15, 2016, directed the Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) to create a National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. A NITRD Task Force on Artificial Intelligence was then formed to define the Federal strategic priorities for AI R&D, with particular attention on areas that industry is unlikely to address. This National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan establishes a set of objectives for Federallyfunded AI research, both research occurring within the government as well as Federally-funded research occurring outside of government, such as in academia. The ultimate goal of this research is to produce new AI knowledge and technologies that provide a range of positive benefits to society, while minimizing the negative impacts. To achieve this goal, this AI R&D Strategic Plan identifies the following priorities for Federally-funded AI research: Strategy 1: Make long-term investments in AI research. Prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a world leader in AI. Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration. Rather than replace humans, most AI systems will collaborate with humans to achieve optimal performance. Research is needed to create effective interactions between humans and AI systems. Strategy 3: Understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. We expect AI technologies to behave according to the formal and informal norms to which we hold our fellow humans. Research is needed to understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and to develop methods for designing AI systems that align with ethical, legal, and societal goals. Strategy 4: Ensure the safety and security of AI systems. Before AI systems are in widespread use, assurance is needed that the systems will operate safely and securely, in a controlled, well-defined, and well-understood manner. Further progress in research is needed to address this challenge of creating AI systems that are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. Strategy 5: Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing. The depth, quality, and accuracy of training datasets and resources significantly affect AI performance. Researchers need to develop high quality datasets and environments and enable responsible access to high-quality datasets as well as to testing and training resources. Strategy 6: Measure and evaluate AI technologies through standards and benchmarks. . Essential to advancements in AI are standards, benchmarks, testbeds, and community engagement that guide and evaluate progress in AI. Additional research is needed to develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques. Strategy 7: Better understand the national AI R&D workforce needs. Advances in AI will require a strong community of AI researchers. An improved understanding of current and future R&D workforce demands in AI is needed to help ensure that sufficient AI experts are available to address the strategic R&D areas outlined in this plan. The AI R&D Strategic Plan closes with two recommendations: Recommendation 1: Develop an AI R&D implementation framework to identify S&T opportunities and support effective coordination of AI R&D investments, consistent with Strategies 1-6 of this plan. Recommendation 2: Study the national landscape for creating and sustaining a healthy AI R&D workforce, consistent with Strategy 7 of this plan.",2023,,,,Open Data,,NCO NITRD,nco@nitrd.gov,,,,,,National natural resource benefits sharing

Small scale solar (approximately less than 0.5 acre) and residential footprints were not included. No other data was used in the production of these shapes. Definitions for the solar facilities identified via imagery are subjective and described as follows: Rooftop Solar: Solar arrays located on rooftops of large buildings. Parking lot Solar: Solar panels on parking lots roughly larger than 1 acre, or clusters of solar panels in adjacent parking lots. Ground Solar: Solar panels located on ground roughly larger than 1 acre, or large clusters of smaller scale footprints. Once all footprints identified by the above criteria were digitized for all California counties, the features were visually classified into ground, parking and rooftop categories. The features were also classified into rural and urban types using the 42 U.S. Code § 1490 definition for rural. In addition, the distance to the closest substation and the percentile category of this distance (e.g. 0-25th percentile, 25th-50th percentile) was also calculated. The coverage provided by this data set should not be assumed to be a complete accounting of solar footprints in California. Rather, this dataset represents an attempt to improve upon existing solar feature datasets and to update the inventory of ""large"" solar footprints via imagery, especially in recent years since previous datasets were published. This procedure produced a total solar project footprint of 150,250 acres. Attempts to classify these footprints and isolate the large utility-scale projects from the smaller rooftop solar projects identified in the data set is difficult. The data was gathered based on imagery, and project information that could link multiple adjacent solar footprints under one larger project is not known. However, partitioning all solar footprints that are at least partly outside of the techno-economic exclusions and greater than 7 acres yields a total footprint size of 133,493 acres. These can be approximated as utility-scale footprints.  Metadata: (1) CBI Solar FootprintsAbstract: Conservation Biology Institute (CBI) created this dataset of solar footprints in California after it was found that no such dataset was publicly available at the time (Dec 2015-Jan 2016). This dataset is used to help identify where current ground based, mostly utility scale, solar facilities are being constructed and will be used in a larger landscape intactness model to help guide future development of renewable energy projects. The process of digitizing these footprints first began by utilizing an excel file from the California Energy Commission with lat/long coordinates of some of the older and bigger locations. After projecting those points and locating the facilities utilizing NAIP 2014 imagery, the developed area around each facility was digitized. While interpreting imagery, there were some instances where a fenced perimeter was clearly seen and was slightly larger than the actual footprint. For those cases the footprint followed the fenced perimeter since it limits wildlife movement through the area. In other instances, it was clear that the top soil had been scraped of any vegetation, even outside of the primary facility footprint. These footprints included the areas that were scraped within the fencing since, especially in desert systems, it has been near permanently altered. Other sources that guided the search for solar facilities included the Energy Justice Map, developed by the Energy Justice Network which can be found here:https://www.energyjustice.net/map/searchobject.php?gsMapsize=large&amp;giCurrentpageiFacilityid;=1&amp;gsTable;=facility&amp;gsSearchtype;=advancedTheSolar Energy Industries Association’s “Project Location Map” which can be found here:https://www.seia.org/map/majorprojectsmap.phpalsoassisted in locating newer facilities along with the ""Power Plants"" shapefile, updated in December 16th, 2015, downloaded from the U.S. Energy Information Administration located here:https://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.cfmTherewere some facilities that were stumbled upon while searching for others, most of these are smaller scale sites located near farm infrastructure. Other sites were located by contacting counties that had solar developments within the county. Still, others were located by sleuthing around for proposals and company websites that had images of the completed facility. These helped to locate the most recently developed sites and these sites were digitized based on landmarks such as ditches, trees, roads and other permanent structures.Metadata: (2) UC Berkeley Solar PointsUC Berkeley report containing point location for energy facilities across the United States.2022_utility-scale_solar_data_update.xlsm (live.com)Metadata: (3) Kruitwagen et al. 2021Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy generating capacity has grown by 41 per cent per year since 2009. Energy system projections that mitigate climate change and aid universal energy access show a nearly ten-fold increase in PV solar energy generating capacity by 2040. Geospatial data describing the energy system are required to manage generation intermittency, mitigate climate change risks, and identify trade-offs with biodiversity, conservation and land protection priorities caused by the land-use and land-cover change necessary for PV deployment. Currently available inventories of solar generating capacity cannot fully address these needs. Here we provide a global inventory of commercial-, industrial- and utility-scale PV installations (that is, PV generating stations in excess of 10 kilowatts nameplate capacity) by using a longitudinal corpus of remote sensing imagery, machine learning and a large cloud computation infrastructure. We locate and verify 68,661 facilities, an increase of 432 per cent (in number of facilities) on previously available asset-level data. With the help of a hand-labelled test set, we estimate global installed generating capacity to be 423 gigawatts (−75/+77 gigawatts) at the end of 2018. Enrichment of our dataset with estimates of facility installation date, historic land-cover classification and proximity to vulnerable areas allows us to show that most of the PV solar energy facilities are sited on cropland, followed by arid lands and grassland.

NUOnet (Nutrient Use and Outcome Network) database,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nuonet-nutrient-use-and-outcome-network-database-5f80f,"NUOnet Vision: Efficient use of nutrients to optimize production and product quality of food for animals and humans, fuel and fiber in a sustainable manner that contributes to ecosystem services. This record contains the DET and Data Dictionary for NUOnet - the data files may be found athttps://usdaars.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=e90392a99d5c427487c6c37cf6d47844Best nutrient management practices are critical for maintaining profitable economic returns, sustaining higher yields, lowering environmental impacts, optimizing nutritional quality, and providing ecosystem services. Best management practices that improve nutrient use efficiencies can reduce nutrient losses from agricultural systems. However, we need to improve our understanding of biological, physical and chemical influences on nutrient processes. For instance, crop use efficiency of nitrogen (N), the primary macronutrient regulating yield and protein content, can be reduced by processes such as denitrification (N2O and N2 emission), leaching (NH4-N, NO3-N, and organic-N), ammonia (NH3-N,) volatilization, surface runoff and erosion, disease, and non-crop competition. Similarly, we need to obtain more information about biological and physical cycles of nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), including factors that influence nutrient availability from fertilizers, crop residues, cover crops, manures, and other byproducts. We need a better understanding of relationships between soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates, and availability and uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients.  In addition, we need information regarding how these practices impact yields, organoleptic qualities, and the macro- and micro-nutritional composition of plants.  This information will improve our ability to develop best nutrient management practices.
Optimal soil nutrient levels are critical for maximizing economic returns, increasing sustainable yields, lowering environmental impacts, sustaining ecosystem services and optimizing nutritional and organoleptic qualities of human and animal foods. Efficient management practices are crucial for increasing economic returns for land managers in a sustainable manner while producing high quality of food for animals and humans with reduced off-site transfer of nutrients from agricultural areas in watersheds. Optimizing N and P inputs requires more information about nutrient inputs from fertilizers, manures, composts, agricultural byproducts, cover crops, and other nutrient sources in addition to nutrient cycling within soils.  This requires data from long-term nutrient management studies across a wide range of soils, crops, and environmental conditions. Land management needs are to connect nutrient management practices for crops with nutrient use efficiency; crop quality; crop chemical composition and nutritional value, quality and acceptability for animal and human health.  Development of databases that enable the scientific exploration of connections among data generated from diverse research efforts such as nutrient management, fate and ecosystem service outcomes, nutritional composition of crops, and animal and human health, is needed.
Nitrogen is a key nutrient that enhances agricultural yield and protein content, but multiple N loss pathways, as previously mentioned, reduce crop N use efficiency (NUE). Implementing proper management practices is needed to reduce N losses from agricultural systems. ARS has multidisciplinary scientific teams with expertise in soils, ecological engineering, hydrology, livestock management and nutrition, horticulture, crop breeding, human and animal nutrition, post-harvest management and processing, and other areas, and intentional collaboration among these teams offers opportunities to rapidly improve NUE and crop quality and reduce off-site N losses. 
Similarly, increased P use efficiencies are needed to enhance and ensure sustainable agricultural production and to reduce environmental degradation of water sources. Manure is a valuable source of P and it can be used as a soil amendment to reduce crop production costs. However, there is a need to improve our understanding of the biological and physical cycles of soil P, as well as to obtain more information about P supplies from fertilizer, crop residues, cover crops, manure, and byproducts, and livestock nutrition impacts on manure properties.
There is also a need for a better understanding of soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates and how their interactions with crops and community ecology affect yield and the uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients and the ultimate nutritional composition and organoleptic qualities of the crop. Studies documenting the responses of crop-associated biological communities to management practices and genetic technologies implemented across multiple environments (e.g., soil types and chemistries, hydrologic regimes, climates) will improve our understanding of gaps in macro- and micro-nutrient management strategies.
A goal of the USDA-ARS is to increase agricultural production and quality while reducing environmental impacts. The Nutrient Uptake and Outcomes (NUOnet) database will be able to help establish baselines on nutrient use efficiencies; processes contributing to nutrient losses; and processes contributing to optimal crop yield, nutritional and organoleptic quality. This national database could be used to calculate many different environmental indicators from a comprehensive understanding of nutrient stocks and flows. Increasing our understanding of stocks and flows could help in the identification of knowledge gaps as well as areas where increased efficiencies can be achieved at a national level. NUOnet could also be used to develop tools to derive cost-benefit curves associated with nutrient management improvement scenarios and assess local, regional and national impacts of off-site nutrient loss. Understanding how agricultural production impacts human health is a challenge, and the database could be used to link crop management strategies to crop chemical composition to human consumption patterns and ultimately to human health outcomes. A national database will also be very important for development and evaluation of new technologies such as real-time sensing or other proximal and remote sensing technologies that enable assessment of nutrient use efficiencies, particularly at the grower level. The database could also be used to develop analyses that will contribute to the recommendation of policies for resource allocations that will most effectively fulfill the goals of the Grand Challenge. Such a national database with contributions from peers across different national programs could also enhance collaborations between ARS, universities, and extension specialists, as well as with producers, industry, and other partners.

National Hydrography Data - NHD and 3DHP,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-0c127,"The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Downloadable Data Collection from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a ""reach code"" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go tohttps://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography.DWR was the steward for NHD and Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in California. We worked with other organizations to edit and improve NHD and WBD, using the business rules for California. California's NHD improvements were sent to USGS for incorporation into the national database. The most up-to-date products are accessible from the USGS website.

Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 24 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrate species. Metrics include all species richness, taxa specific species richness and other lists identifying species of conservation concern, climate vulnerabilities, etc. This dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University, US EPA, and USGS to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

California Fire Perimeters (all),https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/california-fire-perimeters-all-5b4ee,"The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) annually maintains and distributes an historical wildland fire perimeter dataset from across public and private lands in California. The GIS data is developed with the cooperation of the United States Forest Service Region 5, the Bureau of Land Management, California State Parks, National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and is released in the spring with added data from the previous calendar year. Although the dataset represents the most complete digital record of fire perimeters in California, it is still incomplete, and users should be cautious when drawing conclusions based on the data.  This data should be used carefully for statistical analysis and reporting due to missing perimeters (see Use Limitation in metadata). Some fires are missing because historical records were lost or damaged, were too small for the minimum cutoffs, had inadequate documentation or have not yet been incorporated into the database. Other errors with the fire perimeter database include duplicate fires and over-generalization. Additionally, over-generalization, particularly with large old fires, may show unburned ""islands"" within the final perimeter as burned. Users of the fire perimeter database must exercise caution in application of the data. Careful use of the fire perimeter database will prevent users from drawing inaccurate or erroneous conclusions from the data. This data is updated annually in the spring with fire perimeters from the previous fire season. This dataset may differ in California compared to that available from the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) due to different requirements between the two datasets. The data covers fires back to 1878.  As of May 2024, it represents fire23_1. Please help improve this dataset by filling out this survey with feedback:Historic Fire Perimeter Dataset Feedback (arcgis.com)Current criteria for data collection are as follows:CAL FIRE (including contract counties) submit perimeters ≥10 acres in timber, ≥50 acres in brush, or ≥300 acres in grass, and/or ≥3 impacted residential or commercial structures, and/or caused ≥1 fatality.All cooperating agencies submit perimeters ≥10 acres.Version update:Firep23_1 was released in May 2024. Two hundred eighty four fires from the 2023 fire season were added to the database (21 from BLM, 102 from CAL FIRE, 72 from Contract Counties, 19 from LRA, 9 from NPS, 57 from USFS and 4 from USFW).  The 2020 Cottonwood fire, 2021 Lone Rock and Union fires, as well as the 2022 Lost Lake fire were added.  USFW submitted a higher accuracy perimeter to replace the 2022 River perimeter.  Additionally, 48 perimeters were digitized from an historical map included in a publication from Weeks, d. et al. The Utilization of El Dorado County Land. May 1934, Bulletin 572.  University of California, Berkeley.  Two thousand eighteen perimeters had attributes updated, the bulk of which had IRWIN IDs added.

EnviroAtlas - Biodiversity Metrics by 12-digit HUC for the Southwestern United States,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/enviroatlas-biodiversity-metrics-by-12-digit-huc-for-the-southwestern-united-states3,"This EnviroAtlas dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University, US EPA, and the US Geological Survey (USGS) to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems, have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, or cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except fish. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, specific taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, as well as a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity. The EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

The Urban Energy-Water Nexus: Utility-Level Water Flows and Embedded Energy,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/the-urban-energy-water-nexus-utility-level-water-flows-and-embedded-energy-6e27d,"There are limited open source data available for determining water production/treatment and required energy for cities across the United States. This database represents the culmination of a two-year effort to obtain data from cities across the United States via open records requests in order to determine the state of the U.S. urban energy-water nexus. Data were requested at the daily or monthly scale when available for 127 cities across the United States, represented by 253 distinct water and sewer districts. Data were requested from cities larger than 100,000 people and from each state. In the case of states that did not have cities that met these criteria, the largest cities in those states were selected. The resulting database represents a drinking water service population of 81.4 million and a wastewater service population of 86.2 million people. Average daily demands for the United States were calculated to be 560 liters per capita for drinking water and 500 liters per capita of wastewater. The embedded energy within each of these resources is 340 kWh/1000 m3 and 430 kWh/1000 m3, respectively. Drinking water data at the annual scale are available for production volume (89 cities) and for embedded energy (73 cities). Annual wastewater data are available for treated volume (104 cities) and embedded energy (90 cities). Monthly data are available for drinking water volume and embedded energy (73 and 56 cities) and wastewater volume and embedded energy (88 and 70 cities). Please see the two related papers for this metadata are included with this submission.Each folder name is a city that contributed data to the collection effort (City+State Abbreviation). Within each
folder is a .csv file with drinking water and wastewater volume and energy data. A READ-ME file within each folder

Protected Areas Database for New Mexico,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/protected-areas-database-for-new-mexico,"The Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase, managed by USGS GAP, that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and other conservation lands, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. The State, Regional and LCC geodatabases contain two feature classes. The PADUS1_3_FeeEasement feature class and the national MPA feature class. Legitimate and other protected area overlaps exist in the full inventory, with Easements loaded on top of Fee. Parcel data within a protected area are dissolved in this file that powers the PAD-US Viewer. As overlaps exist, GAP creates separate analytical layers to summarize area statistics for ""GAP Status Code"" and ""Owner Name"". Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for more information. The lands included in PAD-US are assigned conservation measures that qualify their intent to manage lands for the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational and cultural uses; managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and voluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves); 2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation or type, parcel name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each mapped land unit 3) GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based on USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) protection level categories which provide a measurement of management intent for long-term biodiversity conservation 4) IUCN category for a protected area's inclusion into UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre's World Database for Protected Areas. IUCN protected areas are defined as, ""A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values"" and are categorized following a classification scheme available through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes linking the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and connecting them to the Global Community. As legitimate and other overlaps exist in the combined inventory GAP creates separate analytical layers to obtain area statistics for ""GAP Status Code"" and ""Owner Name"".

Inventory of online public databases and repositories holding agricultural data in 2017,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/inventory-of-online-public-databases-and-repositories-holding-agricultural-data-in-2017-d4c81,"United States agricultural researchers have many options for making their data available online. This dataset aggregates the primary sources of ag-related data and determines where researchers are likely to deposit their agricultural data. These data serve as both a current landscape analysis and also as a baseline for future studies of ag research data.
Purpose
As sources of agricultural data become more numerous and disparate, and collaboration and open data become more expected if not required, this research provides a landscape inventory of online sources of open agricultural data.
An inventory of current agricultural data sharing options will help assess how the Ag Data Commons, a platform for USDA-funded data cataloging and publication, can best support data-intensive and multi-disciplinary research. It will also help agricultural librarians assist their researchers in data management and publication. The goals of this study were toestablish where agricultural researchers in the United States-- land grant and USDA researchers, primarily ARS, NRCS, USFS and other agencies -- currently publish their data, including general research data repositories, domain-specific databases, and the top journals 
compare how much data is in institutional vs. domain-specific vs. federal platforms
determine which repositories are recommended by top journals that require or recommend the publication of supporting data
ascertain where researchers not affiliated with funding or initiatives possessing a designated open data repository can publish dataApproach 
The National Agricultural Library team focused on Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) style research data, rather than ag economics, statistics, and social sciences data. To find domain-specific, general, institutional, and federal agency repositories and databases that are open to US research submissions and have some amount of ag data, resources including re3data, libguides, and ARS lists were analysed. Primarily environmental or public health databases were not included, but places where ag grantees would publish data were considered.Search methods
We first compiled a list of known domain specific USDA / ARS datasets / databases that are represented in the Ag Data Commons, including ARS Image Gallery, ARS Nutrition Databases (sub-components), SoyBase, PeanutBase, National Fungus Collection, i5K Workspace @ NAL, and GRIN. We then searched using search engines such as Bing and Google for non-USDA / federal ag databases, using Boolean variations of “agricultural data” /“ag data” / “scientific data” + NOT + USDA (to filter out the federal / USDA results). Most of these results were domain specific, though some contained a mix of data subjects.
We then used search engines such as Bing and Google to find top agricultural university repositories using variations of “agriculture”, “ag data” and “university” to find schools with agriculture programs. Using that list of universities, we searched each university web site to see if their institution had a repository for their unique, independent research data if not apparent in the initial web browser search. We found both ag specific university repositories and general university repositories that housed a portion of agricultural data. Ag specific university repositories are included in the list of domain-specific repositories. Results included Columbia University – International Research Institute for Climate and Society, UC Davis – Cover Crops Database, etc. If a general university repository existed, we determined whether that repository could filter to include only data results after our chosen ag search terms were applied. General university databases that contain ag data included Colorado State University Digital Collections, University of Michigan ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), and University of Minnesota DRUM (Digital Repository of the University of Minnesota). We then split out NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) repositories.
Next we searched the internet for open general data repositories using a variety of search engines, and repositories containing a mix of data, journals, books, and other types of records were tested to determine whether that repository could filter for data results after search terms were applied. General subject data repositories include Figshare, Open Science Framework, PANGEA, Protein Data Bank, and Zenodo.
Finally, we compared scholarly journal suggestions for data repositories against our list to fill in any missing repositories that might contain agricultural data. Extensive lists of journals were compiled, in which USDA published in 2012 and 2016, combining search results in ARIS, Scopus, and the Forest Service's TreeSearch, plus the USDA web sites  Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS),  Rural Development (RD), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The top 50 journals' author instructions were consulted to see if they (a) ask or require submitters to provide supplemental data, or (b) require submitters to submit data to open repositories.
Data are provided for Journals based on a 2012 and 2016 study of where USDA employees publish their research studies, ranked by number of articles, including 2015/2016 Impact Factor, Author guidelines, Supplemental Data?, Supplemental Data reviewed?, Open Data (Supplemental or in Repository) Required? and Recommended data repositories, as provided in the online author guidelines for each the top 50 journals.
Evaluation
We ran a series of searches on all resulting general subject databases with the designated search terms. From the results, we noted the total number of datasets in the repository, type of resource searched (datasets, data, images, components, etc.), percentage of the total database that each term comprised, any dataset with a search term that comprised at least 1% and 5% of the total collection, and any search term that returned greater than 100 and greater than 500 results.
We compared domain-specific databases and repositories based on parent organization, type of institution, and whether data submissions were dependent on conditions such as funding or affiliation of some kind. 
Results
A summary of the major findings from our data review:Over half of the top 50 ag-related journals from our profile require or encourage open data for their published authors. 
There are few general repositories that are both large AND contain a significant portion of ag data in their collection. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), ICPSR, and ORNL DAAC were among those that had over 500 datasets returned with at least one ag search term and had that result comprise at least 5% of the total collection.Not even one quarter of the domain-specific repositories and datasets reviewed allow open submission by any researcher regardless of funding or affiliation.See included README file for descriptions of each individual data file in this dataset.

Louisiana_Oysters_2011,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/louisiana_oysters_20112,"1985 Gulf of Mexico Atlas abstract American oyster Crassostrea virginica OstiÃ³n americano Description Range: The American oyster, a bivalve mollusc of the family Ostreidae, is found in the western Atlantic from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Yucatan Peninsula. In the Gulf, this species occurs throughout estuaries, shallow nearshore waters, and on reefs located near river mouths. Habitat: Large populations of this benthic invertebrate are found in the large estuarine bays and sounds of the Gulf (with most concentrations found within 10-meter depths). Sedentary in character, this invertebrate attaches in clusters to shell reefs, firm mud/shell bottoms and other hard substrates. Feeding and Behavior: The American oyster filter-feeds principally on small unicellular algae and incidentally on suspended detrital particles. It is found in association with numerous predators, commensals, and parasites. Reproduction: Spawning also occurs in estuarine habitats. In the Gulf of Mexico, April to October are the most active months, although spawning has been reported during all months except February and March. Nursery areas are found in estuarine waters. Movement: Planktonic larvae drift with the tides and currents until they settle on solid substrate. Fisheries: This species is commercially harvested throughout its range for its meat, the seasonality for harvesting being state regulated. The fishery for this species is the fourth largest in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and there is also a commercial fishery in Mexican waters. The species is harvested recreationally.",2024,,,,Open Data,,Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (Point of Contact),ali.mckenzie@tamucc.edu,,,,,,National natural resource benefits sharing
"Impact of Oleoresin Capsicum Spray on Respiratory Function in Human Subjects in the Sitting and Prone Maximal Restraint Positions in San Diego County, 1998",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/impact-of-oleoresin-capsicum-spray-on-respiratory-function-in-human-subjects-in-the-sittin-61142,"Oleoresin capsicum (OC), or pepper spray, has gained wide
 acceptance as standard police equipment in law enforcement as a swift
 and effective method to subdue violent, dangerous suspects in the
 field. As a use-of-force method, however, OC spray has been alleged in
 the media to have been associated with a number of in-custody
 deaths. The goal of this study was to assess the safety of a
 commercially available OC spray in use by law enforcement agencies
 nationwide. The study was conducted as a randomized, cross-over,
 controlled trial on volunteer human subjects recruited from the local
 law enforcement training academy in San Diego County,
 California. Subjects participated in four different experimental
 trials in random order over two separate days in a pulmonary function
 testing laboratory: (a) placebo spray exposure followed by sitting
 position, (b) placebo spray exposure followed by restraint position,
 (c) OC spray exposure followed by sitting position, and (d) OC spray
 exposure followed by restraint position. Prior to participation,
 subjects completed a short questionnaire regarding their health
 status, history of lung disease and asthma, smoking history,
 medication use, and respiratory inhaler medication use. Prior to
 exposure, subjects also underwent a brief screening spirometry in the
 sitting position by means of a portable spirometry device to determine
 baseline pulmonary function. Subjects then placed their heads in a 5'
 x 3' x 3' exposure box that allowed their faces to be exposed to the
 spray. A one-second spray was delivered into the box from the end
 opposite the subject (approximately five feet away). Subjects remained
 in the box for five seconds after the spray was delivered. During this
 time, subjects underwent impedance monitoring to assess whether
 inhalation of the OC or placebo spray had occurred. After this
 exposure period, subjects were placed in either the sitting or prone
 maximal restraint position. Subjects remained in these positions for
 ten minutes. Repeat spirometric measurements were performed, oxygen
 saturation, blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, and pulse
 rate were recorded, and an arterial blood sample was drawn. A total of
 34 subjects completed the study, comprising 128 separate analyzable
 study trials. Variables provided in all three parts of this collection
 include subject's age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass
 index, past medical history, tobacco use history, and history of
 medication use, as well as OC spray or placebo exposure and sitting or
 restraint position during the trial. Part 1 also includes tidal
 volume, respiratory rate, and heart rate at baseline and at 1, 5, 7,
 and 9 minutes, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline
 and at 3, 6, and 9 minutes. Additional variables in Part 2 include
 predicted forced vital capacity and predicted forced expiratory volume
 in 1 second, and the same measures at baseline, 1.5 minutes, and 10
 minutes. Derived variables include percent predicted and mean percent
 predicted values involving the above variables. Part 3 also provides
 end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygenation levels, oxygen saturation,
 oxygen consumption at baseline and at 1, 5, 7, and 9 minutes, blood
 pH, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide
at 8 minutes.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,Peace Messaging and Media,,,,,

This study examined the impact that a six-month broken windows style policing crackdown on disorder had on residents of three California cities: Colton, Ontario and Redlands.  The study investigated four questions: 
 What is the impact of broken windows policing on fear of crime among residents of the targeted hot spots? 
What is the impact of broken windows policing on police legitimacy in the targeted hot spots? 
What is the impact of broken windows policing on reports of collective efficacy in the targeted hot spots?
 Is broken windows policing at hot spots effective in reducing both actual and perceived levels of disorder and crime in the targeted hot spots? 
To answer these questions, a block randomized experimental design was employed to deliver a police intervention targeting disorder to 55 treatment street segments with an equal number of segments serving as controls.
 Data were collected on the type and amount of crime before, during, and after implementation as well as interviews of residents before and after the crackdown in order to gauge their perception of its success.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,Peace Messaging and Media,,,,,
"Impact Assessment of Sex Offender Notification on Wisconsin Communities, 1998",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/impact-assessment-of-sex-offender-notification-on-wisconsin-communities-1998-e5d3a,"In response to widespread public concern about convicted
 sex offenders being returned from prison, federal and state laws have
 been passed authorizing or requiring the notification of local
 communities where sex offenders would be living. The dilemma
 associated with community notification is balancing the public's
 right to be informed with the need to successfully reintegrate
 offenders within the community. Wisconsin was one of the 50 state
 jurisdictions that enacted a sex offender community notification
 statute. This project was an in-depth study of that state's experience
 from the vantage point of several groups affected by the community
 notification process. This data collection contains three surveys that
 were conducted from January 1998 through mid-September 1998: (1) a
 survey of 704 neighborhood residents at 22 community notification
 meetings throughout the state (Part 1), (2) a statewide survey of 312
 police and sheriff agencies (Part 2), and (3) a statewide survey of
 128 probation and parole agents and their supervisors from units with
 sex offender caseloads (Part 3). Variables in Part 1 include how
 respondents found out about the date and place of the community
 notification meeting, respondents' opinions of the purpose of the
 meeting, how clearly the purpose of meeting was stated, how the
 meeting went, outcomes, rating of information presented, if materials
 were handed out, if the materials were helpful, and respondents' level
 of concern after the meeting. Enforcement agency data (Part 2) include
 variables such as type of agency, type of jurisdiction, population
 size, if the agency designated a special staff member to coordinate
 the sex offender registration and notification functions, if the
 agency had policies regarding registration of sex offenders and
 community notification about sex offenders, if the agency attended
 statewide training, who participated in the Core Notification Team,
 what kind of information was used to determine a sex offender's risk
 to the community, which agencies registered to receive notice, and if
 the agency planned to update or expand their notification list.
 Additional variables cover the number of requests for information from
 Neighborhood Watch Programs, what identifying information about the
 offender the agency released, types of communication the agency
 received from the public after a notification had been issued, topics
 discussed in the public communication to the agency, benefits of the
 community notification law, difficulties in carrying out the
 requirements of the law, and methods developed to handle the
 problems. Probation and parole survey (Part 3) variables focused on
 characteristics of the respondent's supervising area, the number of
 agents assigned to the respondents' unit, the number of agents
 designated as Sex Offender Intensive Supervision Program (SO-ISP)
 agents or SO-ISP back-up agents, the number of child or adult sex
 offenders under probation or parole, if the respondent participated in
 any meetings regarding the provisions of the notification law and its
 implementation, if the supervisor received specialized training, and
 areas covered in the training. Other variables include whether the
 notification level was decided by the Core Notification Team,
 difficulties the respondent had with Special Bulletin Notification
 (SBN) offenders assigned to his/her caseload, if the respondent's
 field unit utilized SO-ISP or ""high risk"" agent teams to manage sex
 offenders, which individuals worked with the respondent's team, the
 type of caseload the respondent supervised, the number of sex
 offenders on the respondent's caseload, if the respondent used a
 special risk assessment or classification instrument for sex
 offenders, other information used to determine the supervision level
 for a sex offender, if child sex offenders were managed differently
 than other sex offenders, how often a polygraph was used on sex
 offenders, who paid for the polygraph, who chose the treatment
 provider, the number of supervision contacts with high-risk, SBN, or
 medium-risk sex offenders per week, victim policies and procedures
 used, rules or policies regarding revocation, and prerevocation
sanctions used.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,Peace Messaging and Media,,,,,

"Public Support for Rehabilitation in Ohio, 1996",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/public-support-for-rehabilitation-in-ohio-1996-0ce7a,"The main focus of this research was on identifying the
 conditions under which public support for rehabilitation varies. A
 single, multivariate analysis method was used so that the influence of
 each respondent, criminal, crime, and treatment characterististic
 could be determined within the context of all other factors. The
 research also explored differences between global and specific
 attitudes toward rehabilitation. Data for this study were collected
 through a mail survey of 1,000 Ohio residents (Part 1). The initial
 mailing was sent to all 1,000 members of the sample on May 28,
 1996. Several followups were conducted, and data collection efforts
 ended on August 26, 1996. Questionnaire items elicited demographic,
 experiential, and attitudinal information from each respondent. To
 assess the potential influence of offender, offense, and treatment
 characteristics on the respondent's support for rehabilitation,
 several variables were combined to create a factorial vignette. This
 method allowed the independent effects of each factor on support for
 rehabilitation to be determined. The respondents were asked to express
 their agreement or disagreement with five statements following the
 vignette: (1) general support for rehabilitation, (2) effectiveness of
 intervention, (3) basing release decisions on progress in
 rehabilitation programs, (4) individualizing sentences to fit
 treatment needs, and (5) expanding treatment opportunities for
 offenders. Types of offenses included in the vignettes were robbery,
 burglary, aggravated assault, larceny, motor vehicle theft, fraud,
 drug sales, and drug use. These offenses were selected since they are
 well-known to the public, offenders are arrested for these offenses
 fairly frequently, and the offenses are potentially punishable by a
 sentence of either prison or probation. Several attributes within the
 particular offenses in the vignettes were designed to assess the
 influence of different levels of harm, either financial or
 physical. Offender characteristics and offense selection for use in
 the vignettes were weighted by their frequency of arrests as reported
 in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1995 Uniform Crime Report
 data. A rating of the seriousness of each offense was assigned using a
 separate survey of 118 undergraduate university students (Part 2), and
 the resulting seriousness score was used in the analysis of the
 vignettes. Additional items on the mail survey instrument assessed the
 respondent's global and specific attitudes toward
 treatment. Independent variables from the mail survey include the
 respondent's age, education, income category, sex, race, political
 party, rating of political conservativism, personal contact with
 offenders, religious identity salience, religiosity, attitudes toward
 biblical literalness and religious forgiveness, fear of crime, and
 victimization. Variables from the vignettes examined whether support
 for rehabilitation was influenced by offender age, race, sex, type of
 offense committed, employment status, substance use, prior record,
 sentence, and treatment program. Global support for rehabilitation was
 measured by responses to two questions: what the respondent thought
 the main emphasis in most prisons was (to punish, to rehabilitate, to
 protect society), and what the main emphasis should be. Items assessed
 variations in the respondent's attitudes toward rehabilitation by
 offender's age, sex, and prior record, location of treatment, and the
 type of treatment provided. Variables from the crime seriousness
 survey recorded the respondent's rating of various crime events,
 including assault and robbery (with or without a weapon, with varying
 degrees of injury, or no injury to the victim), burglary, larceny, and
 auto theft (with varying values of the property stolen), drug dealing,
drug use, and writing bad checks.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,Peace Messaging and Media,,,,,
"Educating the Public About Police Through Public Service Announcements in Lima, Ohio, 1995-1997",https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/educating-the-public-about-police-through-public-service-announcements-in-lima-ohio-1995-1-881df,"This study was designed to analyze the impact of four
 televised public service announcements (PSAs) aired for three months
 in Lima, Ohio. The researchers sought to answer three specific
 research questions: (1) Were the PSAs effective in transferring
 knowledge to citizens about the police? (2) Did the PSAs have an
 impact on resident satisfaction with the police? and (3) Did the PSAs
 have an impact on the behavior of citizens interacting with the
 police? To assess public attitudes about the Lima police and to
 determine whether the substance of the PSAs was being communicated to
 the residents of Lima, three waves of telephone interviews were
 conducted (Part 1). The first telephone interviews were conducted in
 April 1996 with approximately 500 randomly selected Lima
 residents. These were baseline interviews that took place before the
 PSAs aired. The survey instrument used in the first interview assessed
 resident satisfaction with the police and the services they
 provided. After completion of the Wave 1 interviews, the PSAs were
 aired on television for three months (June 5-August 28, 1996). After
 August 28, the PSAs were removed from general circulation. A second
 wave of telephone interviews was conducted in September 1996 with a
 different group of randomly selected Lima residents. The same survey
 instrument used during the first interviews was administered during
 the second wave, with additional questions added relating to whether
 the respondent saw any of the PSAs. A third group of randomly selected
 Lima residents was contacted via the telephone in January 1997 for the
 final wave of interviews. The final interviews utilized the identical
 survey instrument used during Wave 2. The focus of this follow-up
 survey was on citizen retention, over time, of the information
 communicated in the PSAs. Official data collected from computerized
 records maintained by the Lima Police Department were also collected
 to monitor changes in citizen behavior (Part 2). The records data span
 127 weeks, from January 1, 1995, to June 7, 1997, which includes 74
 weeks of pre-PSA data and 53 weeks of data for the period during the
 initial airing of the first PSA and thereafter. Variables in Part 1
 include whether respondents were interested in learning about what to
 do if stopped by the police, what actions they had displayed when
 stopped by the police, if they would defend another person being
 treated unfairly by the police, how responsible they felt (as a
 citizen) in preventing crimes, the likelihood of calling the police if
 they were aware of a crime, perception of crime and fear of crime, and
 whether there had been an increase or decrease in the level of crime
 in their neighborhoods. Respondents were also asked about the amount
 of television they watched, whether they saw any of the public service
 announcements and if so to rate them, whether the PSAs provided
 information not already known, whether any of the PSA topics had come
 up in conversations with family or friends, and whether the
 respondent would like to see more PSAs in the future. Finally,
 respondents were asked whether the police were doing as much as they
 could to make the neighborhood safe, how responsive the police were to
 nonemergency matters, and to rate their overall satisfaction with the
 Lima Police Department and its various services. Demographic variables
 for Part 1 include the race, gender, age, marital status, level of
 education, employment status, and income level of each respondent.
 Variables in Part 2 cover police use-of-force or resisting arrest
 incidents that took place during the study period, whether the PSA
 aired during the week in which a use-of-force or resisting arrest
 incident took place, the number of supplemental police use-of-force
 reports that were made, and the number of resisting arrest charges
made.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,Peace Messaging and Media,,,,,

 implementation of community policing initiatives for three police
 departments in Jefferson County, West Virginia: the Ranson Town Police
 Department, the West Virginia State Police (Jefferson County
 Detachment), and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. The
 evaluation was undertaken by the Free Our Citizens of Unhealthy
 Substances Coalition (FOCUS), a county-based group of citizens who
 represented all segments of the community, including businesses,
 churches, local law enforcement agencies, and local governments. The
 aim was to find answers to the following questions: (1) Can community
 policing have any detectable and measurable impact in a predominantly
 rural setting? (2) Did the police department do what they said they
 would do in their funding application? (3) If they were successful,
 what factors supported their efforts and were key to their success?
 and (4) If they were not successful, what problems prevented their
 success? The coalition conducted citizen surveys to evaluate how much
 of an impact community policing initiatives had in their county. In
 January 1996, research assistants conducted a baseline survey of 300
 households in the county. Survey responses were intended to gauge
 residents' fear of crime and to assess how well the police were
 performing their duties. After one year, the coalition repeated its
 survey of public attitudes, and research assistants interviewed
 another 300 households. The research assumption was that any change in
 fear of crime or assessment of police performance could reasonably be
 attributed to these new community policing inventions. Crime reporting
 variables from the survey included which crime most concerned the
 respondent, if the respondent would report a crime he or she observed,
 and whether the respondent would testify about the crime in
 court. Variables pertaining to level of concern for specific crimes
 include how concerned respondents were that someone would rob or
 attack them, break into or vandalize their home, or try to sexually
 attack them/someone they cared about. Community involvement variables
 covered participation in community groups or activities, neighborhood
 associations, church, or informal social activities. Police/citizen
 interaction variables focused on the number of times respondents had
 called to report a problem to the police in the last two years, how
 satisfied they were with how the police handled the problem, the
 extent to which this police department needed improvement, whether
 children trusted law enforcement officers, whether police needed to
 respond more quickly to calls, whether the police needed improved
 relations with the community, and in the past year whether local
 police performance had improved/gotten worse. Specific crime
 information variables include whether the crime occurred in the
 respondent's neighborhood, whether he/she was the victim, if crime was
 serious in the respondent's neighborhood versus elsewhere, whether the
 respondent had considered moving as a result of crime in the
 neighborhood, and how personal safety had changed in the respondent's
 neighborhood. Variables relating to community policing include whether
 the respondent had heard the term ""community policing"" in the past
 year, from what source, and what community policing activities the
 respondent was aware of. Demographic variables include job
 self-classification, racial/ethnic identity, length of residency, age,
 gender, martial status, educational status, and respondent's town of
residence.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,Peace Messaging and Media,,,,,

Corrections (DOC) had completed three years of operational experience
with ""restorative justice,"" a concept that involves compensating
victims and establishing community-based reparative boards that
determine how offenders can make amends for their crimes. The purpose
of this project was to update the benchmark findings from an earlier
survey of Vermont residents in 1994, to assess public attitudes about
the reforms and changes that had been instituted by the Vermont DOC,
and to explore the possibility of expansion of responsibilities of the
reparative community boards. This project involved a telephone survey
of a new sample of 601 adult residents of Vermont. The interviewing
was conducted on March 15-21, 1999. Respondents were asked a series of
trend questions to update the 1994 findings. Respondents were also
asked questions about two other programs: the diversion program, in
which selected first offenders who fulfilled the terms of a
community-based sanction could have their records expunged, and the
furlough program, in which offenders making the transition from prison
to the community were supervised for an interim period. The survey
also explored whether Vermonters would like to see the
responsibilities of the reparative boards expanded to include
community notification and other types of cases. Residents assessed
whether crime in general, violent crime, and illegal drug use had
increased compared to five years prior, whether more prisons should be
built, whether Vermont's jails and prisons were overcrowded, and
whether violent offenders were being released before completing their
sentences because of overcrowding. They commented on how often
offenders in four scenarios should go to prison and how often they
believed that these offenders in fact did go to prison. Respondents
rated the performance of various segments of the Vermont criminal
justice system and, given 15 offense scenarios, were asked whether the
offender should spend time in jail or in community service and
rehabilitation. In addition, respondents were asked whether anyone in
their household had been a victim of a crime within the last three
years and, if so, whether it was a violent crime. Demographic data
include sex, employment, education, race/ethnicity, and age category
of the respondent, and the county and region where the resident
lived.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,Peace Messaging and Media,,,,,

Within the past fifteen years, policymakers across the country have increasingly supported criminal justice reforms designed to reduce the scope of mass incarceration in favor of less costly, more evidence-based approaches to preventing and responding to crime. One of the primary reform efforts is the Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI), a public-private partnership through which state governments work to diagnose the primary drivers of their state incarceration rates, reform their sentencing policies to send fewer nonviolent offenders to prison, and reinvest the saved money that used to go into prisons into alternatives to incarceration, instead.
This mixed-methods study sought to assess public opinion about the justice reinvestment paradigm of reform and to determine whether exposure to racialized and race-neutral cues affects people's willingness to allocate money into criminal justice institutions versus community-based social services in order to reduce and prevent crime.",2025,,,,Open Data,,National Institute of Justice,opendata@usdoj.gov,Peace Messaging and Media,,,,,

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation.

Provisional drug overdose death counts for specific drugs,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-drug-overdose-death-counts-for-specific-drugs,"This data presents counts of provisional drug overdose deaths by selected drugs and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) public health regions, based on provisional mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System. This data is limited to drug overdose deaths with an underlying cause of death assigned to International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code numbers X40-X44 (unintentional), X60-X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10-Y14 (undetermined intent). Specific drugs were identified using methods for searching literal text from death certificates.The provisional data are based on a current flow of mortality data and include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of drug overdose deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence and specified drug. Provisional drug overdose death counts presented on this page are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2022 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2021 and June 2022), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods. It is important to note that the data represent counts of deaths, and not mortality ratios or rates, which are the standard measure used to compare groups, and therefore should not be used to determine populations at disproportionate risk of drug overdose death.",2025,,,,Open Data,,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,cdcinfo@cdc.gov,,,Preventative protection measures,,,
Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) - Materials and Waste Management in the United States Key Facts and Figures,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sustainable-materials-management-smm-materials-and-waste-management-in-the-united-states-key-fa12,"Each year the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) produces a report titled Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures.

Violence Reduction - Victim Demographics - Aggregated,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-reduction-victim-demographics-aggregated,"This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January – March, April – June, July – September, October – December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.This dataset includes a "" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I "" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (""Y""), No (""N""), or Unknown (""UKNOWN."") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the ""shooting"" column will read either ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as “Y.” Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with ""UNKNOWN"" in the shooting column.The dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor's Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City's public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.How does this dataset classify victims?The methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:Homicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD's homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD's homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD's shooting data tables and absent from CPD's homicide data table.To determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD's Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City's open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD's Victims dataset.For a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD's Crimes and Vi",2025,,,,Open Data,,data.cityofchicago.org,no-reply@data.cityofchicago.org,,,Preventative protection measures,,,

Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US),https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/protected-areas-database-of-the-united-states-pad-us,"This is series-level metadata for the USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) data released by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  PAD-US is the nation's inventory of protected areas, including public land and voluntarily provided private protected areas. Starting with version 1.4 PAD-US was identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastre Theme (https://ngda-cadastre-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/). The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling ""best available"" data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory.For more information regarding the PAD-US dataset please visit,https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/protected-areas/.

Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW),https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/quarterly-census-of-employment-and-wages-qcew-a6fea,"The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) Program is a Federal-State cooperative program between the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the California EDD’s Labor Market Information Division (LMID). The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by California Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program.The QCEW program serves as a near census of monthly employment and quarterly wage information by 6-digit industry codes from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the national, state, and county levels. At the national level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data for nearly every NAICS industry. At the state and local area level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data down to the 6-digit NAICS industry level, if disclosure restrictions are met. In accordance with the BLS policy, data provided to the Bureau in confidence are used only for specified statistical purposes and are not published. The BLS withholds publication of Unemployment Insurance law-covered employment and wage data for any industry level when necessary to protect the identity of cooperating employers.Data from the QCEW program serve as an important input to many BLS programs. The Current Employment Statistics and the Occupational Employment Statistics programs use the QCEW data as the benchmark source for employment. The UI administrative records collected under the QCEW program serve as a sampling frame for the BLS establishment surveys.In addition, the data serve as an input to other federal and state programs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce uses the QCEW data as the base for developing the wage and salary component of personal income.The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and California's EDD use the QCEW data to administer the Unemployment Insurance program. The QCEW data accurately reflect the extent of coverage of California’s UI laws and are used to measure UI revenues; national, state and local area employment; and total and UI taxable wage trends.The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes new QCEW data in its County Employment and Wages news release on a quarterly basis.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2014 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes sex, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.

These data and generalized derivatives are the only international boundary lines approved for U.S. Government use.  The contents of this dataset reflect U.S. Government policy on international boundary alignment, political recognition, and dispute status.  They do not necessarily reflect de facto limits of control.National Geospatial Data AssetThis dataset is a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDAID 194) managed by the Department of State.  It is a part of the International Boundaries Theme created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.Dataset Source DetailsSources for these data include treaties, relevant maps, and data from boundary commissions, as well as national mapping agencies.  Where available and applicable, the dataset incorporates information from courts, tribunals, and international arbitrations.  The research and recovery process includes analysis of satellite imagery and elevation data.  Due to the limitations of source materials and processing techniques, most lines are within 100 meters of their true position on the ground.Cartographic VisualizationThe LSIB is a geospatial dataset that, when used for cartographic purposes, requires additional styling. The LSIB download package contains example style files for commonly used software applications.  The attribute table also contains embedded information to guide the cartographic representation.

These are two-character codes derived from the Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes Standard (GENC), Edition 3 Update 18.  “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC3” fields contain the corresponding three-character GENC codes and are extension attributes discussed below.  The codes “Q2” or “QX2” denote a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with areas not contained within the GENC standard.The “COUNTRY1” and “COUNTRY2” fields contain the names of corresponding political entities.  These fields contain names approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) as incorporated in the ‘""Independent States in the World"" and ""Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty"" lists maintained by the Department of State.  To ensure maximum compatibility, names are presented without diacritics and certain names are rendered using common cartographic abbreviations.  Names for lines associated with the code ""Q2"" are descriptive and not necessarily BGN-approved. Names rendered in all CAPITAL LETTERS denote independent states.   Names rendered in normal text represent dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, or are otherwise presented for the convenience of the user.Descriptive FieldsThe following text fields are a part of the core attributes of the LSIB dataset and do not update from external sources. They provide additional information about each of the lines and are as follows:
ATTRIBUTE NAME | CONTAINS NULLS
RANK | No
STATUS | No 
LABEL | Yes
NOTES | YesNeither the ""RANK"" nor ""STATUS"" fields contain null values; the ""LABEL"" and ""NOTES"" fields do.
The ""RANK"" field is a numeric expression of the ""STATUS"" field.  Combined with the line geometry, these fields encode the views of the United States Government on the political status of the boundary line.A value of “1” in the “RANK” field corresponds to an ""International Boundary"" value in the “STATUS” field.  Values of ”2” and “3” correspond to “Other Line of International Separation” and “Special Line,” respectively.The “LABEL” field contains required text to describe the line segment on all finished cartographic products, including but not limited to print and interactive maps.The “NOTES” field contains an explanation of special circumstances modifying the lines.  This information can pertain to the origins of the boundary lines, limitations regarding the purpose of the lines, or the original source of the line.Use of Core Attributes in Cartographic VisualizationSeveral of the Core Attributes provide information required for the proper cartographic representation of the LSIB dataset.  The cartographic usage of the LSIB requires a visual differentiation between the three categories of boundary lines.  Specifically, this differentiation must be between:
- International Boundaries (Rank 1);
- Other Lines of International Separation (Rank 2); and
- Special Lines (Rank 3).Rank 1 lines must be the most visually prominent.  Rank 2 lines must be less visually prominent than Rank 1 lines.  Rank 3 lines must be shown in a manner visually subordinate to Ranks 1 and 2.  Where scale permits, Rank 2 and 3 lines must be labeled in accordance with the “Label” field.  Data marked with a Rank 2 or 3 designation does not necessarily correspond to a disputed boundary.  Please consult the style files in the download package for examples of this depiction.The requirement to incorporate the contents of the ""LABEL"" field on cartographic products is scale dependent.  If a label is legible at the scale of a given static product, a proper use of this dataset would encourage the application of that label.  Using the contents of the ""COUNTRY1"" and ""COUNTRY2"" fields in the generation of a line segment label is not required.  The ""STATUS"" field contains the preferred description for the three LSIB line types when they are incorporated into a map legend but is otherwise not to be used for labeling.Use of the “CC1,” “CC1_GENC3,” “CC2,” “CC2_GENC3,” “RANK,” or “NOTES” fields for cartographic labeling purposes is prohibited.Extension AttributesCertain elements of the attributes within the LSIB dataset extend data functionality to make the data more interoperable or to provide clearer linkages to other datasets.The fields “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC” contain the corresponding three-character GENC code to the “CC1” and “CC2” attributes.  The code “QX2” is the three-character counterpart of the code “Q2,” which denotes a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with a geographic area not contained within the GENC standard.To allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and World Polygons dataset, the “CC1_WPID” and “CC2_WPID” fields contain a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), version 4, which provides a stable description of each geographic entity in a boundary pair relationship.  Each UUID corresponds to a geographic entity listed in the World Polygons dataset.  These fields allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and the overall World Polygons dataset.Five additional fields in the LSIB expand on the UUID concept and either describe features that have changed across space and time or indicate relationships between previous versions of the feature.The “LSIB_ID” attribute is a UUID value that defines a specific instance of a feature.  Any change to the feature in a lineset requires a new “LSIB_ID.”The “ANTECIDS,” or antecedent ID, is a UUID that references line geometries from which a given line is descended in time.  It is used when there is a feature that is entirely new, not when there is a new version of a previous feature.  This is generally used to reference countries that have dissolved.The “PREVIDS,” or Previous ID, is a UUID field that contains old versions of a line.  This is an additive field, that houses all Previous IDs.  A new version of a feature is defined by any change to the feature—either line geometry or attribute—but it is still conceptually the same feature.The “PARENTID” field introduces a concept of hierarchy into the data model.  This UUID field links related Rank 2 and Rank 3 lines to their corresponding Rank 1 line.  If two political entities share multiple boundary lines of different Rank or Status, this field contains an identifier that assembles all line segments together.The “PARENTSEG” field, which is a future-use field, contains information pertaining to constituent parts of a boundary line of the same rank or status.External Data SourcesCertain elements of the LSIB incorporate elements of other published data sources.

Historically, USDA databases have been used for national nutrition monitoring (1). Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the ""Primary Data Set"" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR. 
 
The current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014, is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods. These nutrient data will be used for assessing intake data from WWEIA, NHANES 2013-2014. Nutrient profiles were added for 265 new foods and updated for about 500 foods from the version used for the previous survey (WWEIA, NHANES 2011-12).  New foods added include mainly commercially processed foods such as several gluten-free products, milk substitutes, sauces and condiments such as sriracha, pesto and wasabi, Greek yogurt, breakfast cereals, low-sodium meat products, whole grain pastas and baked products, and several beverages including bottled tea and coffee, coconut water, malt beverages, hard cider, fruit-flavored drinks, fortified fruit juices and fruit and/or vegetable smoothies. Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample.

National Hydrography Data - NHD and 3DHP,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-0c127,"The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Downloadable Data Collection from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a ""reach code"" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go tohttps://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography.DWR was the steward for NHD and Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in California. We worked with other organizations to edit and improve NHD and WBD, using the business rules for California. California's NHD improvements were sent to USGS for incorporation into the national database. The most up-to-date products are accessible from the USGS website. Please note that the California portion of the National Hydrography Dataset is appropriate for use at the 1:24,000 scale.For additional derivative products and resources, including the major features in geopackage format, please go to this page:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-major-featuresArchives of previous statewide extracts of the NHD going back to 2018 may be found athttps://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-archive.In September 2022, USGS officially notified DWR that the NHD would become static as USGS resources will be devoted to the transition to the new 3D Hydrography Program (3DHP). 3DHP will consist of LiDAR-derived hydrography at a higher resolution than NHD. Upon completion, 3DHP data will be easier to maintain, based on a modern data model and architecture, and better meet the requirements of users that were documented in the Hydrography Requirements and Benefits Study (2016). The initial releases of 3DHP will be the NHD data cross-walked into the 3DHP data model. It will take several years for the 3DHP to be built out for California.

BLM NM REGION CadNSDI TOWNSHIPS FOR NM,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/blm-nm-region-cadnsdi-townships-for-nm-12c64,"This data represents the GIS Version of the Public Land Survey System including both rectangular and non-rectangular survey data. The rectangular survey data are a reference system for land tenure based upon meridian, township/range, section, section subdivision and government lots. The non-rectangular survey data represent surveys that were largely performed to protect and/or convey title on specific parcels of land such as mineral surveys and tracts. The data are largely complete in reference to the rectangular survey data at the level of first division. However, the data varies in terms of granularity of its spatial representation as well as its content below the first division. Therefore, depending upon the data source and steward, accurate subdivision of the rectangular data may not be available below the first division and the non-rectangular minerals surveys may not be present. At times, the complexity of surveys rendered the collection of data cost prohibitive such as in areas characterized by numerous, overlapping mineral surveys. In these situations, the data were often not abstracted or were only partially abstracted and incorporated into the data set. These PLSS data were compiled from a broad spectrum or sources including federal, county, and private survey records such as field notes and plats as well as map sources such as USGS 7 ½ minute quadrangles. The metadata in each data set describes the production methods for the data content. This data is optimized for data publication and sharing rather than for specific ""production"" or operation and maintenance. A complete PLSS data set includes the following: PLSS Townships, First Divisions and Second Divisions (the hierarchical break down of the PLSS Rectangular surveys) PLSS Special surveys (non-rectangular components of the PLSS) Meandered Water, Corners, Metadata at a Glance (which identified last revised date and data steward) and Conflicted Areas (known areas of gaps or overlaps or inconsistencies). The Entity-Attribute section of this metadata describes these components in greater detail. The second division of the PLSS is quarter, quarter-quarter, sixteenth or government lot division of the PLSS. The second and third divisions are combined into this feature class as an intentional de-normalization of the PLSS hierarchical data. The polygons in this feature class represent the smallest division to the sixteenth that has been defined for the first division. For example In some cases sections have only been divided to the quarter. Divisions below the sixteenth are in the Special Survey or Parcel Feature Class.

Allegheny County Elevated Blood Lead Level Rates,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/allegheny-county-elevated-blood-lead-level-rates,"Lead is a neurotoxin commonly found in our daily lives. While lead has been eliminated from gasoline, household paint, and solder, you can still be exposed to lead from many different sources including dust containing lead from pre-1978 lead paint, paint chips, contaminated soils, water, ceramic plates, bowls, and glasses, and imported candy, toys, cosmetics, and jewelryLead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that no safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, academic achievement, and other behavioral issues.As of January 1, 2018, Allegheny County requires every child under age six to be tested for lead exposure. The first of two tests will be conducted when a child is approximately 9-12 months old, and the second test will take place around the child’s second birthday. According to the Allegheny County Health Department, 53% of County children born in 2016 were tested for lead between the ages of nine to 12 months. This share has risen from 30% of County children born in 2009.Children are initially tested with a capillary, or “finger prick” blood test. If an elevated level of lead is found, a venous blood test will be administered to confirm the result. For more information on the testing methods, please see the Allegheny County Health Department’s Lead Exposure in Allegheny County report, released in September, 2018. The Allegheny County Health Department currently treats confirmed blood lead level tests with 5 µg/dL or more of lead as elevated. This measurement is based on the CDC’s reference level for public health action, established in May 2012.If a child under age 6 tests with a confirmed blood lead level of 5 µg/dl and above, ACHD offers a free home inspection. The goal of this inspection, along with XRF readings, sampling of dust, soil, and water, is to help identify any sources of lead exposure in the home. The inspection includes identifying possible alternative sources of lead exposure from jewelry, toys, cosmetics, parent occupations and/or hobbies. Inspectors also educate the family about how good nutrition can mitigate absorption of lead and immediate steps the family can take to reduce lead exposure in the home. ACHD also offers free lead testing for the uninsured or underinsured at its Immunization clinic, and at WIC offices in McKeesport and Wilkinsburg.The Allegheny Lead Safe Homes Program currently provides free home repairs to keep families safe from lead paint. This program will test for lead-based paint in the home and will aid with repairs and prevention education to Allegheny County homeowners or renters who meet income requirements and whose home is built before 1978. All work is done in a lead-safe manner. Eligible residents must either have a child under 6 years or a pregnant woman in the household.For additional information about how to use this data accurately and responsibly, please refer to the County'sdata guideInformation appearing in this description was drawn from the following sources:Lead Exposure in Allegheny County (September 2018pdf report)Allegheny County Health Department’s Lead Exposure Prevention (Website)Allegheny County Health Department’s Lead Testing (Website)Data about lead in Allegheny County (Website)Allegheny County Health Department’s Approach to Lead (Website)Allegheny County Lead Safe Homes program information (Website)Allegheny County’s Article XXIII Blood Lead Testing Regulation (pdf document)",2023,,,,Open Data ,,Allegheny County,Alyssa.Monaghan@alleghenycounty.us,,,,,,Transboundary water sharing

The Urban Energy-Water Nexus: Utility-Level Water Flows and Embedded Energy,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/the-urban-energy-water-nexus-utility-level-water-flows-and-embedded-energy-6e27d,"There are limited open source data available for determining water production/treatment and required energy for cities across the United States. This database represents the culmination of a two-year effort to obtain data from cities across the United States via open records requests in order to determine the state of the U.S. urban energy-water nexus. Data were requested at the daily or monthly scale when available for 127 cities across the United States, represented by 253 distinct water and sewer districts. Data were requested from cities larger than 100,000 people and from each state. In the case of states that did not have cities that met these criteria, the largest cities in those states were selected. The resulting database represents a drinking water service population of 81.4 million and a wastewater service population of 86.2 million people. Average daily demands for the United States were calculated to be 560 liters per capita for drinking water and 500 liters per capita of wastewater. The embedded energy within each of these resources is 340 kWh/1000 m3 and 430 kWh/1000 m3, respectively. Drinking water data at the annual scale are available for production volume (89 cities) and for embedded energy (73 cities). Annual wastewater data are available for treated volume (104 cities) and embedded energy (90 cities). Monthly data are available for drinking water volume and embedded energy (73 and 56 cities) and wastewater volume and embedded energy (88 and 70 cities). Please see the two related papers for this metadata are included with this submission.Each folder name is a city that contributed data to the collection effort (City+State Abbreviation). Within each
folder is a .csv file with drinking water and wastewater volume and energy data. A READ-ME file within each folder
details the contents of the folder within any relevant information pertaining to data collection. Data are on the
order of a monthly timescale when available, and yearly if not.Please cite the following papers when using the database:
