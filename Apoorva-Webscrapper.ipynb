       "  'Description': 'This table contains data on the percent of adults (18 years or older) who are registered voters and the percent of adults who voted in general elections, for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the Statewide Database, University of California Berkeley Law, and the California Secretary of State, Elections Division. The table is part of a series of indicators in theHealthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity.Political participation can be associated with the health of a community through two possible mechanisms: through the implementation of social policies or as an indirect measure of social capital. Disparities in political participation across socioeconomic groups can influence political outcomes and the resulting policies could have an impact on the opportunities available to the poor to live a healthy life. Lower representation of poorer voters could result in reductions of social programs aimed toward supporting disadvantaged groups. Although there is no direct evidentiary connection between voter registration or participation and health, there is evidence that populations with higher levels of political participation also have greater social capital. Social capital is defined as resources accessed by individuals or groups through social networks that provide a mutual benefit. Several studies have shown a positive association between social capital and lower mortality rates, and higher self- assessed health ratings. There is also evidence of a cycle where lower levels of political participation are associated with poor self-reported health, and poor self-reported health hinders political participation. More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.',\n",

       "  'Description': 'The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Downloadable Data Collection from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go tohttps://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography.DWR was the steward for NHD and Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in California. We worked with other organizations to edit and improve NHD and WBD, using the business rules for California. California\\'s NHD improvements were sent to USGS for incorporation into the national database. The most up-to-date products are accessible from the USGS website. Please note that the California portion of the National Hydrography Dataset is appropriate for use at the 1:24,000 scale.For additional derivative products and resources, including the major features in geopackage format, please go to this page:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-major-featuresArchives of previous statewide extracts of the NHD going back to 2018 may be found athttps://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-archive.In September 2022, USGS officially notified DWR that the NHD would become static as USGS resources will be devoted to the transition to the new 3D Hydrography Program (3DHP). 3DHP will consist of LiDAR-derived hydrography at a higher resolution than NHD. Upon completion, 3DHP data will be easier to maintain, based on a modern data model and architecture, and better meet the requirements of users that were documented in the Hydrography Requirements and Benefits Study (2016). The initial releases of 3DHP will be the NHD data cross-walked into the 3DHP data model. It will take several years for the 3DHP to be built out for California. Please refer to the resources on this page for more information.The FINAL,STATIC version of the National Hydrography Dataset for California was published for download by USGS on December 27, 2023. This dataset can no longer be edited by the state stewards.The first public release of the 3D Hydrography Program map service may be accessed athttps://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/3DHP_all/MapServer.Questions about the California stewardship of these datasets may be directed to nhd_stewardship@water.ca.gov.',\n",

On February 11, 2019, the President signed Executive Order 13859, Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence. This order launched the American AI Initiative, a concerted effort to promote and protect AI technology and innovation in the United States. The Initiative implements a whole-of-government strategy in collaboration and engagement with the private sector, academia, the public, and like-minded international partners. Among other actions, key directives in the Initiative call for Federal agencies to prioritize AI research and development (R&empD) investments, enhance access to high-quality cyberinfrastructure and data, ensure that the Nation leads in the development of technical standards for AI, and provide education and training opportunities to prepare the American workforce for the new era of AI. In support of the American AI Initiative, this National AI R&empD Strategic Plan: 2019 Update defines the priority areas for Federal investments in AI R&empD. This 2019 update builds upon the first National AI R&empD Strategic Plan released in 2016, accounting for new research, technical innovations, and other considerations that have emerged over the past three years. This update has been developed by leading AI researchers and research administrators from across the Federal Government, with input from the broader civil society, including from many of America’s leading academic research institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private sector technology companies. Feedback from these key stakeholders affirmed the continued relevance of each part of the 2016 Strategic Plan while also calling for greater attention to making AI trustworthy, to partnering with the private sector, and other imperatives.',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) holds tremendous promise to benefit nearly all aspects of society, including the economy, healthcare, security, the law, transportation, even technology itself. On February 11, 2019, the President signed Executive Order 13859, Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence. This order launched the American AI Initiative, a concerted effort to promote and protect AI technology and innovation in the United States. The Initiative implements a whole-of-government strategy in collaboration and engagement with the private sector, academia, the public, and like-minded international partners. Among other actions, key directives in the Initiative call for Federal agencies to prioritize AI research and development (R&empD) investments, enhance access to high-quality cyberinfrastructure and data, ensure that the Nation leads in the development of technical standards for AI, and provide education and training opportunities to prepare the American workforce for the new era of AI. In support of the American AI Initiative, this National AI R&empD Strategic Plan: 2019 Update defines the priority areas for Federal investments in AI R&empD. This 2019 update builds upon the first National AI R&empD Strategic Plan released in 2016, accounting for new research, technical innovations, and other considerations that have emerged over the past three years. This update has been developed by leading AI researchers and research administrators from across the Federal Government, with input from the broader civil society, including from many of America’s leading academic research institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private sector technology companies. Feedback from these key stakeholders affirmed the continued relevance of each part of the 2016 Strategic Plan while also calling for greater attention to making AI trustworthy, to partnering with the private sector, and other imperatives.',\n",

       "  'Description': 'The November 30, 2018, magnitude (Mw) 7.1 Anchorage, Alaska earthquake triggered substantial ground failure throughout Anchorage and surrounding areas (Grant and others, 2020; Jibson and others, 2020). The earthquake was an intraslab event with a focal depth of about 47 km and an epicenter about 16 km north of the city of Anchorage. Peak ground accelerations reached ∼30% g. Despite the relatively low severity of most of the ground failure occurrences, geotechnical damage to buildings and structures was widespread (Franke and others, 2019).\\nHere, we present an inventory of the earthquake-triggered ground failure based on information compiled from numerous data sources. The inventory is comprised of 886 points that each correspond to the location of earthquake triggered ground failure associated with the 2018 event (Figure 1). For each instance of ground failure, the direct observation is reported and, where possible, is categorized based on the process interpreted to have caused it. For example, an observation of a rock fall would be categorized as a landslide. Similarly, a sand boil would be categorized as evidence of liquefaction. Where possible, the features were more precisely mapped with an additional polygon (n=179) and or line feature (n=32). To determine the existence and location of ground failure features, we relied on a variety of mapping methods and data sources. As such, the certainty in the mapping of each feature within the inventory varies (Figure 2). Details on how uncertainty is reported as well as the methods and data sources used are discussed in the following sections.Data and Methods\\nThe inventory was compiled using a variety of different sources and methods with varying levels of success (Martinez and others, 2021). To convey this, the overall mapping certainty for each feature within the inventory is determined by assigning a semi-quantitative grade for categories related to the certainty of the existence of the feature, the positional accuracy of the mapped feature, and the mapped delineation quality. Those categories are denoted as presence, location, and delineation certainty in the inventory attribute table.  Confidence grade definitions, and all other inventory attributes, are described in Table 1.\\nAs previously mentioned, we relied on a variety of methods and data sources to develop the ground failure inventory. We primarily relied on field observation data and information shared from federal, state, and local agencies. These data sources were particularly helpful where remotely sensed data were not available or insufficient for mapping ground failure. Here, we summarize how remotely sensed data were used and in which ways they were advantageous or insufficient. High resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are typically used to develop high-quality ground failure inventories. We began our ground failure mapping efforts by differencing high resolution pre- and post-earthquake lidar derived DEMs from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (AK DNR)  Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) elevation portal (DGGS Elevation Portal (alaska.gov)). The pre- and post-earthquake DEMs used to identify and map the extent of ground failure in this study had an areal overlap of approximately 321 km2. These data cover only a small portion of the area that experienced moderate to severe shaking during the earthquake (60,690 km2) as estimated from the USGS ShakeMap.In regions lacking sufficient DEM coverage we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) differencing to identify and map ground failure. NDVI maps are derived from multispectral imagery and display the relative health or existence of vegetation in a landscape. For this study, NDVI maps were derived using imagery from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI) (Drusch and others, 2012).  Ground failure that is severe enough to disturb vegetation can be mapped by differencing pre- and post- earthquake NDVI maps. However, efforts to create NDVI maps of the landscape following the earthquake were hindered due to snowfall that began to accumulate shortly after the earthquake (2 December 2018). To overcome this limitation, we used Google Earth Engine (Gorelick and others, 2017) to create composites of multispectral images of the summers (May 1 to July 30) before and after the earthquake instead. The image composites were then used to create NDVI maps that were differenced to determine where there were any significant changes in vegetation that could potentially correspond to ground failure. While the resolution of the data used for the NDVI differencing (10-m) is lower than that used for DEM differencing (1-m) it is advantageous as it is available globally, and thus, for the entire earthquake affected region of Southcentral, Alaska.Despite the advantage of globally available NDVI data, the method is still limited in its ability to detect smaller and more subtle vegetation changes. Our comparisons may also include some landslides that were not triggered by the earthquake but happened in the time spanned by the images. When possible, satellite and aerial imagery alone were also used to map ground failure features. However, in most instances the imagery alone was inadequate for mapping because many features were not visible in available satellite imagery. In addition, the ground surface was obscured in satellite imagery as a result of snow fall that occurred shortly after the earthquake. Some features, such as large road cracks, were not visible following snowmelt as they were quickly repaired by The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. Other ephemeral features, such as sand boils or cracks on tidal flats, were no longer visible in satellite imagery after snowmelt and several tidal cycles.\\nRemotely sensed data alone were found to be insufficient for mapping ground failure associated with this event (see Martinez and others, 2021). In addition to the limitations of remotely sensed data, the aforementioned snowfall that occurred immediately after the earthquake obscured large swaths of land and subsequently hindered efforts to gather ground failure observations while in the field. Thus, in addition to the remotely sensed data, the inventory was supplemented with field observations gathered by U.S. Geological Survey scientists shortly after the event (Grant and others, 2020), information on earthquake damage supplied from federal (FEMA Region X), state (The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities) and local agencies (Municipality of Anchorage, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Matanuska-Susitna Borough Department of Emergency Services, 673 Civil Engineers Squadron at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Anchorage Fire Station 12) as well as compiled social media information and data from literature on the 2018 earthquake event.\\nUsing the data mentioned above, we inferred which ground failure process to assign to each ground failure location based on contextual information such as the environment and presence of evidence that suggests ground failure may have occurred. We assigned the “landslide” process to locations where there are indications of the downhill movement of material. A modified classification scheme based on Keefer (1984) was used to classify the observed landslide features within our inventory (see Table 1 for landslide classification scheme). Evidence that liquefaction processes may have occurred include the presence of ground cracks, sand boils, lateral spreads, the settlement of structures, and rapid soil flows. In cases where direct evidence of liquefaction is lacking (i.e., sand boils), the classification is based on proximity to identified sand boils. Liquefaction was interpreted to be the process for observed lateral spreading features parallel to water bodies. Low-lying features on flat slopes (e.g., settlement alone) for which there is no direct evidence to suggest that liquefaction occurred are given the label “Liquefaction (Ambiguous)” to reflect the uncertain nature in their process designation.Despite the use of supplemental data, the inventory is still considered incomplete, with varying levels of completeness throughout the region. Adverse environmental conditions including snow fall, limited daylight hours, a large earthquake-affected area, and accessibility constraints limited the extent to which both field and remotely sensed observations could be reliably used to compile a ground failure inventory. To communicate this variability in inventory completeness and quality, Figure 2 displays the region, highlighted in white, in which direct observations of ground failure were made in addition to where high-resolution pre- and post-earthquake lidar data are available. This higher-confidence mapping region displays where the inventory is considered complete and high quality due to the nature of the data (i.e., direct observations, high-quality lidar) used for mapping in this region.

Furthermore, the activity seeks to improve capacity building of school councils to increase social auditing and monitoring of education services, empower communities and parents to monitor early grade reading outcomes, and hold education personnel accountable to local communities for learning outcomes. The activity aims to reach close to 110,000 1st and 2nd grade students to grade level reading competence, allowing them to easily understand what they are reading and master future knowledge. By the end of the activity, it is expected that over 27,000 of these students will be reading with fluency. Recent accomplishments include: 116 School Councils actively participating in and monitoring annual school plans and teacher/student tardiness and absenteeism; 116 school libraries established within existing school structures with 70 titles of books provided, and 144 teachers trained in library management and reading information; Increased number of community users of the Olavula SMS platform that enables parents and communities to ask questions and demand solutions from schools and school directors; and 116 District Education Plans elaborated based on critical gaps identified by School Councils and local Civil Society Organizations.',\n",

The geographic distribution of these salmon spans the North Pacific Ocean \\n                (NPO), where they occupy a variety of ecosystems and water masses throughout their ocean life \\n                history phase. There are significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate \\n                distribution, productivity/survival in coastal and high seas environments. These gaps hamper our \\n                ability to usefully inform management decisions related to fisheries and habitat across \\n                freshwater, coastal and high seas ecosystems.\\n                As a changing climate and associated anomalous events in the large marine ecosystems of the \\n                NPO progressively expose Pacific salmon to conditions that are outside the \"normal\" climate \\n                cycles, society will confront new resource management issues. These include the future of the \\n                cultures and subsistence lifestyles of local Indigenous communities, potential impacts of \\n                industrial activities (e.g., commercial fishing), potential changes to regional ocean carrying \\n                capacity, and resilience of North Pacific marine ecosystems. In addition, the growing threat of \\n                illegal, unreported, and unregulated high seas fishing and the recovery of salmon populations \\n                listed under the US Endangered Species Act and Canadian Species at Risk Act has increased the \\n                need for timely advice about salmon distribution.\\n                An international effort is required to detect and monitor changes in salmon and their ecosystem\\n                because stocks from all major salmon States of origin are distributed in the NPO. Salmon \\n                originate in producer nations rivers migrate through the exclusive economic zones of coastal \\n                states and intermingle in the high seas. In response to this need, the NPAFC, with partners and \\n                collaborating scientists in academia, NGOs and the private sector, is conducting an ambitious \\n                high seas research expedition with up to five research vessels surveying the full breadth of the \\n                NPO in late winter 2022. The expedition will test a collaborative research framework to better \\n                understand the mechanisms and processes that regulate the distribution and abundance of Pacific \\n                salmon and steelhead trout; to promote sustainable populations of anadromous populations in the \\n                NPO; to allow for better forecasts of salmon production trends in the future; and to enhance the \\n                sustainable fisheries management, food security, and economic security in salmon States. \\n                Our key methodological approach is to conduct an international survey of salmon and their \\n                ecosystems in the offshore regions of the NPO by deploying survey vessels at key times and \\n                areas to provide a seasonal picture of the distribution, migration and ecology of salmon in the \\n                high seas.

The study includes (1) an evaluability assessment of 17 sites to determine their readiness for an evaluation, (2) a process evaluation and system reform assessment of the 17 sites, (3) a feasibility assessment of using case level data for an outcome evaluation, and analysis of a subset of unsubmitted SAK cases to identify how characteristics of incidents, offenders, and victims are associated with case processing decisions and outcomes, and (4) development of a long-term outcome evaluation plan.\\nTwo sources of data are archived with NAJCD: (1) coded qualitative data from primarily on-site interviews the Westat Team conducted in 2018 with stakeholders from 17 of the fiscal year (FY) 2015 SAKI grantees and 2 private lab facilities and 2) quantitative case-level data from the 2 FY 2015 SAKI grantees on SAKI cases associated with previously unsubmitted sexual assault kits that were determined to contain foreign DNA or biological evidence through laboratory testing. The interview data file contains coded data from 172 interviews the research team conducted with one or more agency representatives regarding their organization's goals, strategies, and activities for processing sexual assault kits, and associated lessons learned, challenges, and expected outcomes.  The quantitative case-level data file includes case-level information on 576 sexual assault kits determined to have DNA and associated cases included in the 2 sites' SAKI inventories. The case-level data captures information on case or offense-level information (e.g., date of offense, date offense reported to police, number of victims and suspects involved, investigation and prosecution activities), victim-level information (e.g., victim age, sex, race, participation in investigation), and suspect-level information (e.g., suspect's age, race, sex, criminal history).\",\n",

The research team conducted three web-based Law Enforcement Organizations (LEO) surveys of sworn and civilian law enforcement employees (LEO Survey A Data, n=22,765; LEO Survey B Data, n=15,825; and LEO Survey C Data, n=16,483). The sample was drawn from the 2007 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) database. Agencies with 100 to 3,000 sworn police personnel were eligible for participation. To collect data for the Police-Community Interaction (PCI) survey (PCI Data, n=16,659), each week department employees extracted names and addresses of persons who had recent contact with a police officer because of a reported crime incident, traffic accident or traffic stop.

       "  'Description': 'This project provided the first large-scale examination of the police response to intimate partner violence and of the practice known as \"dual arrest.\"  The objectives of the project were: (1) to describe the prevalence and context of dual arrest in the United States, (2) to explain the variance in dual arrest rates throughout the United States, (3) to describe dual arrest within the full range of the police response to intimate partner violence, (4) to analyze the factors associated with no arrest, single arrest, and dual arrest, (5) to examine the reasons why women are arrested in intimate partner cases, and (6) to describe how the criminal justice system treats women who have been arrested for domestic violence.  Data for the project were collected in two phases. In Phase I, researchers examined all assault and intimidation cases in the year 2000 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) database (NATIONAL INCIDENT-BASED REPORTING SYSTEM, 2000 [ICPSR 3449]) to investigate the extent to which dual arrest is occurring nationwide, the relationship between incident and offender characteristics, and the effect of state laws on police handling of these cases for all relationship types. Because the NIBRS dataset contained a limited number of incident-specific variables that helped explain divergent arrest practices, in Phase II, researchers collected more detailed information on a subset of NIBRS cases from 25 police departments of varying sizes across four states. This phase of the study was restricted to intimate partner and other domestic violence cases. Additional data were collected for these cases to evaluate court case outcomes and subsequent re-offending. This phase also included an assessment of how closely department policy reflected state law in a larger sample of agencies within five states. The data in Part 1 (Phase I Data) contain 577,862 records from the NIBRS. This includes information related to domestic violence incidents such as the most serious offense against the victim, the most serious victim injury, the assault type, date of incident, and the counts of offenses, offenders, victims, and arrests for the incident. The data also include information related to the parties involved in the incident including demographics for the victim(s) and arrestee(s) and the relationship between victim(s) and arrestee(s). There is also information related to the jurisdiction in which the incident occurred such as population, urban/rural classification, and whether the jurisdiction is located in a metropolitan area.  There are also variables pertaining to whether a weapon was used, the date of arrest, and the type of arrest.  Also included are variables regarding the police department such as the number of male and female police officers and civilians employed. The data in Part 2 (Phase II Data) contain 4,388 cases and include all of the same variables as those in Part 1. In addition to these variables, there are variables such as whether the offender was on the scene when the police arrived, who reported the incident, the exact nature of injuries suffered by the involved parties, victim and offender substance use, offender demeanor, and presence of children. Also included are variables related to the number of people including police and civilians who were on the scene, the number of people who were questioned, whether there were warrants for the victim(s) or offender(s), whether citations were issued, whether arrests were made, whether any cases were prosecuted, the number of charges filed and against whom, and the sentences for prosecuted cases that resulted in conviction. The data in Part 3 (Police Department Policy Data) contain 282 cases and include variables regarding whether the department had a domestic violence policy, what the department\\'s arrest policy was, whether a police report needed to be made, whether the policy addressed mutual violence, whether the policy instructed how to determine the primary aggressor, and what factors were taken into account in making a decision to arrest. There is also information related to the proportion of arrests involving intimate partners, the proportion of arrests involving other domestics, the proportion of arrests involving acquaintances, and the proportion of arrests involving strangers.',\n",

This dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report in support of a consent decree executed between the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois (OAG) and the City of Chicago.The CPD is currently engaged in a reform process, as governed by that consent decree. A consent decree is a written settlement resolving a legal dispute. The OAG/City of Chicago consent decree includes detailed requirements organized into 11 core areas (e.g., use of force, accountability and transparency), collectively designed to create organizational change within CPD. To review the consent decree and learn more about the process, see the City of Chicago’s police reform webpage:https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/police-reform/home/consent-decree.htmlThis dataset is made available to the public pursuant to consent decree requirements described in Paragraph 79 and Paragraph 80.Paragraph 79 of the consent decree states that:\\nBy April 1, 2020, and every year thereafter, CPD will conduct an assessment of the relative frequency of all misdemeanor arrests and administrative notices of violation (“ANOVs”) effectuated by CPD members of persons in specific demographic categories, including race and gender.Then, the last sentence of Paragraph 80 states that: \\nUpon completion of the assessment, CPD will publish the underlying data, excluding personal identifying information (e.g., name, address, contact information), via a publicly-accessible, web-based data platform.This dataset was used by CPD analysts to create an assessment report pursuant to Paragraph 79. The report was designed to achieve compliance with Paragraph 79. Each record in the dataset shows information about an ANOV issued by a CPD member. An ANOV is a citation issued for violating a Municipal Code of Chicago ordinance. ANOV’s are adjudicated by the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings (DOAH). ANOV data are owned and housed by the Department of Administrative Hearings. CPD receives a daily data extraction from the DOAH data system, whereupon ANOV data is ingested into the CPD data system.To request the aforementioned report contact the CPD Freedom of Information Act Section athttps://home.chicagopolice.org/information/freedom-of-information-act-foia..NOV NUMBER is the record identifier for the dataset.

       "  'Description': 'This project sought to analyze states\\' and municipalities\\'\\n terrorism preparedness as a means of providing law enforcement with\\n information about the prevention and control of terrorist activities\\n in the United States. To accomplish this objective, a national survey\\n of state and local law enforcement agencies was conducted to assess\\n how law enforcement agencies below the federal level perceive the\\n threat of terrorism in the United States and to identify potentially\\n promising anti- and counter-terrorism programs currently used by these\\n jurisdictions. For the purposes of this survey, the researchers used\\n the legal definition of terrorism as provided by the Federal Bureau of\\n Investigation (FBI), which is \"the unlawful use of force or violence\\n against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the\\n civilian population, or any segment of either, to further political or\\n social objectives.\" However, incidents reported by state or local law\\n enforcement agencies as potential terrorist incidents often are\\n reclassified as ordinary crimes by the FBI if the FBI investigation\\n does not reveal evidence that more than one crime was intended to be\\n committed or that a network of individuals had prepared to carry out\\n additional acts. Since these reported potential terrorist incidents\\n may provide important early warnings that an organized terrorism\\n effort is emerging, the researchers broadened the official definition\\n to include suspected incidents and state and local officials\\'\\n perceptions of crime due to terrorism. Three distinct jurisdictions\\n with overlapping responsibilities for terrorism preparedness were\\n surveyed in this study: (1) state law enforcement agencies, in most\\n cases the state police, (2) organizations with emergency preparedness\\n responsibilities and statewide authority but with limited powers of\\n law enforcement, and (3) local law enforcement agencies, such as\\n municipal police and sheriff departments. Similar questions were asked\\n for all three jurisdiction groups. Variables pertaining to the\\n organization include questions about contingency plans, guidelines,\\n and special police training for dealing with threats of terrorism, the\\n amount and types of information and resources exchanged among various\\n agencies, and whether the agency had a special terrorism unit and, if\\n so, its duties. Variables dealing with threat assessment include\\n whether the agency had identified right-wing, left-wing,\\n international, ethnic/emigre, or special-issue terrorist groups within\\n their jurisdiction and how many incidents were attributed to each\\n group. Additional variables provide information on whether the agency\\n was involved in investigating any terrorist incidents and the type of\\n support received from other agencies for these investigations. The\\n risk assessment section of the survey sought information on whether\\n the agency had conducted a risk assessment and what potential\\n terrorist targets were present in their jurisdiction. Questions in the\\n threat environment section cover the respondent\\'s assessment of the\\n impact of the Persian Gulf War, the agency\\'s sources of information\\n pertaining to terrorism, the likelihood of terrorist attacks on\\n various major installations nationally, and the likelihood of a major\\n attack in their jurisdiction. Administrative variables include the\\n number of sworn officers or professional staff, number of support\\n staff, department\\'s budget for the current fiscal year, whether the\\n agency received federal funds, and what percentage of the federal\\nfunds were used for anti-terrorism efforts.',\n",

Non-charges cases go through the Department Advocate\\'s Office (DAO) and are recorded as non-APU where relevant in the table, while charges cases are prosecuted by the Administrative Prosecution Unit (APU) and are marked as APU penalties and recommendations. In all cases the NYPD Commissioner will issue a final penalty, labeled as \"NYPD Officer Penalty\" in the dataset.The dataset is part of a database of all public police misconduct records the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) maintains on complaints against New York Police Department uniformed members of service received in CCRB\\'s jurisdiction since the year 2000, when CCRB\\'s database was first built. This data is published as four tables:Civilian Complaint Review Board: Police Officers\\nCivilian Complaint Review Board: Complaints Against Police Officers\\nCivilian Complaint Review Board: Allegations Against Police Officers\\nCivilian Complaint Review Board: PenaltiesA single complaint can include multiple allegations, and those allegations may include multiple subject officers and multiple complainants.Public records exclude complaints and allegations that were closed as Mediated, Mediation Attempted, Administrative Closure, Conciliated (for some complaints prior to the year 2000), or closed as Other Possible Misconduct Noted.This database is inclusive of prior datasets held on Open Data (previously maintained as \"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) - Complaints Received,\" \"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) - Complaints Closed,\" and \"Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) - Allegations Closed\") but includes information and records made public by the June 2020 repeal of New York Civil Rights law 50-a, which precipitated a full revision of what CCRB data could be considered public.',\n",

       "  'Description': \"The purpose of this study was twofold. First, researchers\\n wanted to assess the benefits of the driving while intoxicated (DWI)\\n drug court established in the Las Cruces, New Mexico, Municipal Court\\n in an effort to determine its future viability. This was accomplished\\n by examining the behaviors and attitudes of three groups of convicted\\n drunk-drivers and determining the extent to which these groups were\\n different or similar. The three groups included: (1) non-alcoholic\\n first- and second-time offenders (non-alcoholic offenders), (2)\\n alcoholic first- and second-time DWI offenders (alcoholic offenders),\\n and (3) chronic three-time (or more) DWI offenders (chronic\\n offenders). The second purpose of this study was to explore police\\n officers' attitudes toward court-based treatment programs for DWI\\n offenders, while examining the distinguishing characteristics between\\n police officers who support court-based programs for drunk drivers and\\n those who are less likely to support such sanctions. Data for Part 1,\\n Drug Court Survey Data, were collected using a survey questionnaire\\n distributed to non-alcoholic, alcoholic, and chronic offenders. Part 1\\n variables include blood alcohol level, jail time, total number of\\n prior arrests and convictions, the level of support from the\\n respondents' family and friends, and whether the respondent thought\\n DWI was wrong, could cause injury, or could ruin lives. Respondents\\n were also asked whether they acted spontaneously in general, took\\n risks, found trouble exciting, ever assaulted anyone, ever destroyed\\n property, ever extorted money, ever sold or used drugs, thought lying\\n or stealing was OK, ever stole a car, attempted breaking and entering,\\n or had been a victim of extortion. Demographic variables for Part 1\\n include the age, gender, race, and marital status of each\\n respondent. Data for Part 2, Police Officer Survey Data, were\\n collected using a survey questionnaire designed to capture what police\\n officers knew about the DWI Drug Court, where they learned about it,\\n and what factors accounted for their attitudes toward the program.\\n Variables for Part 2 include police officers' responses to whether DWI\\n court was effective, whether DWI laws were successful, the perceived\\n effect of mandatory jail time versus treatment alone, major problems\\n seen with DWI policies, if DWI was considered dangerous, and how the\\n officer had learned or been briefed about the drug court. Other\\n variables include the number of DWI arrests, and whether respondents\\n believed that reforms weaken police power, that DWI caused more work\\n for them, that citizens have bad attitudes, that the public has too\\n many rights, and that stiffer penalties for DWI offenders were more\\nsuccessful.\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'This dataset consists of growth and yield data for each season when soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was grown for seed at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). In the 1994, 2003, 2004, and 2010 seasons, soybean was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. In 2019, soybean was grown on four large, precision weighing lysimeters and their surrounding 4.4 ha fields. The square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with four fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Soybean was grown on different combinations of fields in different years. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1995, 2003, 2004, and 2010 although in 2010 only one irrigation was applied to establish the crop after which it was grown as a dryland crop. Irrigation protocols described as full were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. Irrigation protocols described as deficit typically involved irrigations to establish the crop early in the season, followed by reduced or absent irrigations later in the season (typically in the later winter and spring).\\nThe growth and yield data include plant population density, height, plant row width, leaf area index, growth stage, total above-ground biomass, leaf and stem biomass, head mass (when present), kernel or seed number, and final yield. Data are from replicate samples in the field and non-destructive (except for final harvest) measurements on the weighing lysimeters. In most cases yield data are available from both manual sampling on replicate plots in each field and from machine harvest. Machine harvest yields are commonly smaller than hand harvest yields due to combine losses.\\nThese datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on soybean ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.\\nSee the README for descriptions of each data file.

       "  'Description': 'The aim of this study was to examine the factors related to\\ndifferent patterns of male violence against women. Employing both\\nintra-individual and sociocultural perspectives, the project focused\\non the relationship between violence against women and previously\\nestablished risk factors for intimate partner violence including\\nstressors related to work, economic status, and role transitions\\n(e.g., pregnancy), as well as family power dynamics, status\\ndiscrepancies, and alcohol use. The following research questions were\\naddressed: (1) To what extent do Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic\\nindividuals engage in physical violence with their partners? (2) How\\nare socioeconomic stressors associated with violent relationships\\namong Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic couples? (3) To what extent are\\nchanges in patterns of physical violence against women associated with\\ndifferent stages of a relationship (e.g., cohabitation, early\\nmarriage, pregnancy, marriage)? (4) To what extent do culturally\\nlinked attitudes about family structure (family power dynamics)\\npredict violence among Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic couples? (5) To\\nwhat extent do family strengths and support systems contribute to the\\ncessation of violence among Caucasian, Black, and Hispanic couples?\\n(6) What is the role of alcohol use in violent relationships among\\nCaucasian, Black, and Hispanic couples? The data used for this project\\ncame from the first and second waves of the National Survey of\\nFamilies and Households (NSFH) conducted by the Center for Demography\\nand Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison [NATIONAL SURVEY OF\\nFAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLDS: WAVE I, 1987-1988, AND WAVE II, 1992-1994\\n(ICPSR 6906)]. The NSFH was designed to cover a broad range of family\\nstructures, processes, and relationships with a large enough sample to\\npermit subgroup analysis. For the purposes of this study, the\\nanalytical sample focused on only those couples who were cohabiting or\\nmarried at the time of the first wave of the study and still with the\\nsame person at the time of the second wave (N=3,584). Since the study\\ndesign included oversamples of previously understudied groups (i.e.,\\nBlacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans), racial and ethnic comparisons were\\npossible. In both waves of the NSFH several identical questions were\\nasked regarding marital conflicts. Both married and cohabiting\\nrespondents were asked how often they used various tactics including\\nheated arguments and hitting or throwing things at each other to\\nresolve their conflicts. In addition, respondents were asked if any of\\ntheir arguments became physical, how many of their fights resulted in\\neither the respondent or their partner hitting, shoving, or throwing\\nthings, and if any injuries resulted as a consequence of these\\nfights. This data collection consists of the SPSS syntax used to\\nrecode variables from the original NSFH dataset. In addition, new\\nvariables, including both composite variables (e.g., self-esteem,\\nhostility, depression) and husband and wife versions of the variables\\n(using information from both respondent and partner), were\\nconstructed. New variables were grouped into the following categories:\\ndemographic, personality, alcohol and drug use, relationship stages,\\ngender role attitudes, division of labor, fairness in household\\nchores, social support, and isolation. Psychological well-being scales\\nwere created to measure autonomy, positive relations with others,\\npurpose in life, self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and personal\\ngrowth. Additional scales were created to measure relationship\\nconflict, sex role gender attitudes, personal mastery, alcohol use,\\nand hostility. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale and the Center for\\nEpidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were also utilized.',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Frequent, reliable transit service is the foundation of a transportation system that empowers all travelers and makes Seattle a truly transit-friendly city. A robust transit network is essential if Seattle is to meet its climate goals and address transportation-related inequities. At its most fundamental level, a transit network is made up of transit infrastructure such as bus lanes, transit signals, and bus stops, often arranged in corridors.\\xa0\\xa0The transit service that travels on this infrastructure can be described as a series of routes that connect different parts of a community for a number of hours per day at a certain frequency (the number of trips at a bus stop per hour). SDOT’s vision for the service aspect of the transit network is followed by a vision for transit infrastructure in the sections below.\\xa0Public input and surveys consistently point to transit frequency as the most critical factor that influences ridership behavior. This fundamental concept directly informs SDOT’s shared vision for a “Frequent Transit Network” (FTN), which builds from the 2016 Transit Master Plan (TMP) and establishes aspirational frequency targets for transit corridors throughout the city. A high-frequency transit network enables people to move through the city with confidence in a timely arrival—and without the need to consult a schedule—throughout the day and every single day of the week. Continual investment in improved transit frequency in Seattle is essential for many reasons:\\xa0\\xa0Post-pandemic transit is likely to remain less commuter-focused and oriented specifically to Downtown Seattle and must adapt to new travel behaviors and patterns.\\xa0To support everyday trips by transit (not just commutes), people need reliable mobility at all times, such as early mornings, midday, evenings and at night all days of the week, not just at peak times on weekdays.\\xa0\\xa0Transit needs to accommodate work schedules of non-traditional and low-income workers including the times noted above.\\xa0Transit should be attractive for all types of trips throughout the week, including education, shopping, and recreational trips, as well as cultural gatherings.\\xa0An excellent transit network is necessary to accommodate the mode shift required to respond to the impacts of climate change in the next decade.\\xa0Frequent transit reduces wait time, increases reliability, and values the time for existing and future riders.\\xa0Frequent transit makes transfers more feasible and allows a network of routes to function as a system.\\xa0A connected network of frequent transit services is also critical to achieve STP climate goals, which require dramatic increases in transit ridership and VMT reduction to support broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation.\\xa0\\xa0High transit frequencies as part of a reliable, all-day service network can create a more equitable transportation system, making it possible for people of all ages, incomes, and abilities to get where they want to go regardless of when or where they need to travel. The Transit Element presents a vision for frequent transit service in Seattle that goes beyond the original Frequent Transit Network (FTN) presented in the 2016 Transit Master Plan.\\xa0\\xa0Refresh Cycle: None, Static.

       "  'Description': \"TO5 2.3.2: Large-Scale Temperature StudyAlthough space-conditioning systems are required to meet standards such as those in the Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) Manual RS (Rutkowski 1997) and the ASHRAE Standard 55 (ASHRAE 2013) comfort criteria, little is known about how space-conditioning systems are actually operating in the field and if these systems are meeting those standards. Unconventional space-conditioning systems may be necessary for low-load homes in the future. It is important to know how current systems are functioning in existing homes and to what temperatures occupants typically set the thermostats in their homes.The U.S. Department of Energy's Building America research team IBACOS set out to find some answers. By using low-cost data loggers and occupant surveys to monitor 37 single-family homes that have standard heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment, the team gained insight into how sensitive occupants are to comfort in their homes relative to the ACCA and ASHRAE standards. This study focused on one climate zone (hot-humid); however, future studies may find differences among occupants- ideas of thermal comfort in other climate zones. Data were collected from installed sensors during a 2-month period from late August 2014 through late October 2014. The final aspect of this project was to review the business metrics associated with builders involved in a comfort and performance guarantee program.The results of this study-taken as an aggregate-show that the homes provided room-to-room temperature differences less than 6 degrees F 95% of the time. Temperature differences were less than 4 degrees F 80% of the time. Some homes showed better or worse performance. On average, two-story homes had a 3.3 degrees F temperature difference between rooms; single-story homes had an average of a 2.2 degrees F temperature difference between rooms. Occupants who did not use programmable thermostats had an average set point of 75 degrees F. Homes in which the thermostats were programmed with a setback schedule showed a median baseline temperature value of 74 degrees F and had a median afternoon setback of 75 degrees F.System runtime was analyzed and showed that the room-to-room temperature uniformity in some homes worsened during an on cycle, whereas the uniformity improved in other homes. That is, when the system was running, some rooms were receiving too much or too little air relative to the rest of the house, and the temperatures in those rooms were moving away from the temperatures of the other rooms in the house.Finally, analysis of the thermostat data shows a wide degree of variability among homes in the study. Interpretation of the measured data suggests that 21 occupants made no regular adjustments to the thermostats in their homes, seven had regular setbacks, seven showed varying setbacks, and 10 appeared to follow no pattern (with random adjustments).Ultimately, the data show that current systems are maintaining expected levels of comfort. As expected, it is more challenging to maintain a uniform temperature in all rooms of two-story homes, and future systems should address this issue. Furthermore, the data show that the majority of homes maintained relative humidity levels below 60% without any supplemental dehumidification\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Research examining racial disparities in the court system has typically focused on only one of the discrete stages in the criminal process (the charging, conviction, or sentencing stages), with the majority of the literature focusing on the sentencing stage. The literature has thus largely ignored the key early decisions made by the prosecutor such as their decision to prosecute, the determination of preliminary charges, charge reductions, and plea negotiations. Further, the few studies that have examined whether racial disparities arise in prosecutorial charging decisions are rarely able to follow these cases all the way through the criminal court process. This project sought to expand the literature by using a dataset on felony cases filed in twelve Virginia counties between 2007 through 2015 whereby each criminal incident can be followed from the initial charge filing stage to the final disposition. Using each felony case as the unit of analysis, this data was used to evaluate whether African Americans and whites that are arrested for the same felony crimes have similar final case outcomes.',\n",

DART(R) stations have been sited in regions with a history of generating destructive tsunamis to ensure early detection of tsunamis and to acquire data critical to real-time forecasts. DART(R) systems consist of an anchored seafloor bottom pressure recorder (BPR) and a companion moored surface buoy for real-time communications. An acoustic link transmits data from the BPR on the seafloor to the surface buoy. The data are then relayed via an Iridium satellite link to ground stations, which demodulate the signals for immediate dissemination to NOAA's Tsunami Warning Centers, NDBC, and PMEL. The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, formerly the National Geophysical Data Center--NGDC) serves as the archive center for this data and provides the historical data to users.\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'As the occurrence and severity of coral bleaching has increased in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) since the 1980s, The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other scientists have developed remote sensing products and a network of environmental monitoring stations in order to try to more accurately predict coral bleaching in the Florida Keys.  However, although remote sensing and in-situ data collection can provide an indication of when environmental conditions are ideal for the onset of coral bleaching, the actual onset of bleaching can be a gradual process, and effects can vary over an area as large as the FKNMS.  In order to accurately assess the initial affects of bleaching events, and to assess coral condition during and after bleaching events, the Florida Keys BleachWatch program coordinates a large network of trained observers to provide regular reports of actual coral conditions on the reefs.Each BleachWatch observer receives a packet containing information on the project and FAQâ\\x80\\x99s on coral bleaching, report forms complete with detailed instructions, and an underwater visual aid.  The report form has been designed to minimize the effort needed to make observations and report on conditions, and the underwater visual aids are designed to minimize gear for the diver to carry yet be easily accessible and available when needed to help make mental notes on coral condition throughout the dive.  The underwater visual aid provides a summary of the important information needed from the monitoring form such as environmental conditions as well as images to help determine percent of bleached live coral cover and major growth types for ease of coral identification.  After exiting the water, observers simply enter these and any other notable observations on the report form provided. Observers are asked to report as regularly as possible, and are made to understand that observations of no bleaching present are equally as important.By interpreting observations of coral condition from various areas within a geographic zone of concern during potential bleaching events, additional insight can be gained toward determining natural resilience, both for habitat types, geographical location, and species of coral.  This information will allow researchers to further develop the accuracy of available coral bleaching early warning products and assist resource managers to better communicate the condition of the reefs as potential bleaching events occur, as well as potentially integrating the information into existing management plans.',\n",

These respondents completed the survey in one of two ways. One set of respondents completed the survey on a tablet with the help of the research team, while the other group self-administered the survey on their own mobile device. The method used to complete the survey was randomly selected. A third option (paper and pencil with an administrator) was initially included but was removed early in the survey's deployment. The survey was administered from May 2018 to March 2019 in the respondent's preferred language (English or Spanish). \\nThis collection contains 1,620 variables, and includes derived variables for several scales used in the questionnaire. Bias victimization measures considered both hate crimes (e.g. physical assault) and non-criminal bias events (e.g. racial slurs) and allowed the respondent to report multiple incidents, perpetrators, and types of bias victimization. The respondents were asked about their help-seeking and reporting behaviors for the experience of bias victimization they considered to be the most severe and the measures considered both formal (e.g. contacting the police) and informal (e.g. communicating with family) help-seeking behaviors. The victimization scale measured exposure to traumatic events (e.g. witnessing a murder) as well as experiences of victimization (e.g. physical assault). Acculturation and enculturation scales measured topics such as the respondent's use of Spanish and English and their consumption of media in both languages. The variables pertaining to acculturative stress considered factors such as feelings of social isolation, experiences of racism, and conflict with family members. The variables for mental health outcomes measured symptoms of anger, anxiety, depression, and disassociation.\",\n",

First, to develop new integrated computational technology that can mine, monitor, and screen for the occurrence of behaviors associated with dangerously escalating extremism in large heterogenous databases and provide early warnings of individuals or groups on behavioral trajectories toward extremist violence. Second, to harness data science methodologies to enable rapid, semi-automated support for law enforcement analysts and social science researchers to produce structured behavioral indicator profiles from text sources.\\nThe study operated from the premise that being that violent extremists are a rare, complex phenomenon, it is futile to search for a profile of extremism. Rather, it is better to focus on explaining how people come to embrace violent extremism. This path, referred to here as a radicalization trajectory, implies that an arc exists leading the perpetrator from entertaining extremist ideas to action, and that there is a somewhat predictable pathway from a normal, if perhaps angry state, to the perpetration of a violent attack in the name of the ideology. Two teams were combined to analyze radicalization trajectories: data collection and analysis led by Brandeis University and technology development led by Colorado State University (CSU).\\nThe questions revolving around the technological development were as follows: Can tools that rigorously examine and account for the activities of close associates better predict the likelihood that an individual would engage in violent extremism? Which risk assessment indicators for violent extremism in the extant literature are detectable via automated or semi-automated technologies, and what databases and datasets must be integrated to facilitate this detection? Can computationally efficient tools be used to mine these databases for the specific purposes of monitoring and screening for individuals and small groups posing a significant risk for violence?\\nUsers should refer to the data collection notes field below for additional information about study citation.',\n",

VMF is a veteran-only housing unit for male inmates who have served in the U.S. military. When the grant was written, experts in the field had noted that the population of veterans returning to the U.S. with numerous mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and depression, were increasing and as a result, the number of veterans incarcerated in jails and prisons was also expected to increase. While numerous specialized courts for veterans had been implemented across the country at the time, veteran-specific housing units for those already sentenced to serve time in custody were rarer and no evaluations of these units had been published. Since this evaluation grant was awarded, the number of veteran-only housing units has increased, demonstrating the need for more evaluation information regarding lessons learned.\\nA core goal when creating VMF was to structure an environment for veterans to draw upon the positive aspects of their shared military culture, create a safe place for healing and rehabilitation, and foster positive peer connections. There are several components that separate VMF from traditional housing with the general population that relate to the overall environment, the rehabilitative focus, and initiation of reentry planning as early as possible. These components include the selection of correctional staff with military backgrounds and an emphasis on building on their shared experience and connecting through it; a less restrictive and more welcoming environment that includes murals on the walls and open doors; no segregation of inmates by race/ethnicity; incentives including extended dayroom time and use of a microwave and coffee machine (under supervision); mandatory rehabilitative programming that focuses on criminogenic and other underlying risks and needs or that are quality of life focused, such as yoga, meditation, and art; a VMF Counselor who is located in the unit to provide one-on-one services to clients, as well as provide overall program management on a day-to-day basis; the regular availability of VA staff in the unit, including linkages to staff knowledgeable about benefits and other resources available upon reentry; and the guidance and assistance of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) to support reentry transition for individuals needing additional assistance.\\nThe general criteria for housing in this veteran module includes: (1) not being at a classification level above a four, which requires a maximum level of custody; (2) not having less than 30 days to serve in custody; (3) no state or federal prison holds and/or prison commitments; (4) no fugitive holds; (5) no prior admittance to the psychiatric security unit or a current psychiatric hold; (6) not currently a Post-Release Community Supervision Offender serving a term of flash incarceration; (7) not in custody for a sex-related crime or requirement to register per Penal Code 290; (8) no specialized housing requirements including protective custody, administration segregation, or medical segregation; and (9) no known significant disciplinary incidents.\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January – March, April – June, July – September, October – December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. Aggregating at the quarter level provides large enough blocks of incidents to protect anonymity while allowing the end user to observe inter-year and intra-year variation. Any row where there were fewer than three incidents during a given quarter has been deleted to help prevent re-identification of victims. For example, if there were three domestic criminal sexual assaults during January to March 2020, all victims associated with those incidents have been removed from this dataset. Human trafficking victimizations have been aggregated separately due to the extremely small number of victimizations.This dataset includes a \" GUNSHOT_INJURY_I \" column to indicate whether the victimization involved a shooting, showing either Yes (\"Y\"), No (\"N\"), or Unknown (\"UKNOWN.\") For homicides, injury descriptions are available dating back to 1991, so the \"shooting\" column will read either \"Y\" or \"N\" to indicate whether the homicide was a fatal shooting or not. For non-fatal shootings, data is only available as of 2010. As a result, for any non-fatal shootings that occurred from 2010 to the present, the shooting column will read as “Y.” Non-fatal shooting victims will not be included in this dataset prior to 2010; they will be included in the authorized dataset, but with \"UNKNOWN\" in the shooting column.The dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Each time the dataset is refreshed, records can change as CPD learns more about each victimization, especially those victimizations that are most recent. The data on the Mayor\\'s Office Violence Reduction Dashboard is updated daily with an approximately 48-hour lag. As cases are passed from the initial reporting officer to the investigating detectives, some recorded data about incidents and victimizations may change once additional information arises. Regularly updated datasets on the City\\'s public portal may change to reflect new or corrected information.How does this dataset classify victims?The methodology by which this dataset classifies victims of violent crime differs by victimization type:Homicide and non-fatal shooting victims: A victimization is considered a homicide victimization or non-fatal shooting victimization depending on its presence in CPD\\'s homicide victims data table or its shooting victims data table. A victimization is considered a homicide only if it is present in CPD\\'s homicide data table, while a victimization is considered a non-fatal shooting only if it is present in CPD\\'s shooting data tables and absent from CPD\\'s homicide data table.To determine the IUCR code of homicide and non-fatal shooting victimizations, we defer to the incident IUCR code available in CPD\\'s Crimes, 2001-present dataset (available on the City\\'s open data portal). If the IUCR code in CPD\\'s Crimes dataset is inconsistent with the homicide/non-fatal shooting categorization, we defer to CPD\\'s Victims dataset.For a criminal homicide, the only sensible IUCR codes are 0110 (first-degree murder) or 0130 (second-degree murder). For a non-fatal shooting, a sensible IUCR code must signify a criminal sexual assault, a robbery, or, most commonly, an aggravated battery. In rare instances, the IUCR code in CPD\\'s Crimes and Vi',\n",

Scores are calculated and placed on a scale ranging from 0 (extremely low risk) to 500 (extremely high risk).Based on this time frame’s version of the Strategic Subject Algorithm, individuals with criminal records are ranked using eight attributes, not including race or sex. These attributes are: number of times being the victim of a shooting incident, age during the latest arrest, number of times being the victim of aggravated battery or assault, number of prior arrests for violent offenses, gang affiliation, number of prior narcotic arrests, trend in recent criminal activity and number of prior unlawful use of weapon arrests.Please note that this data set includes fields that are not used to calculate SSL, for example, neither race nor sex are used in the Strategic Subject Algorithm. Portions of the arrest data are de-identified on the basis of privacy concerns.

First, to develop new integrated computational technology that can mine, monitor, and screen for the occurrence of behaviors associated with dangerously escalating extremism in large heterogenous databases and provide early warnings of individuals or groups on behavioral trajectories toward extremist violence. Second, to harness data science methodologies to enable rapid, semi-automated support for law enforcement analysts and social science researchers to produce structured behavioral indicator profiles from text sources.\\nThe study operated from the premise that being that violent extremists are a rare, complex phenomenon, it is futile to search for a profile of extremism. Rather, it is better to focus on explaining how people come to embrace violent extremism. This path, referred to here as a radicalization trajectory, implies that an arc exists leading the perpetrator from entertaining extremist ideas to action, and that there is a somewhat predictable pathway from a normal, if perhaps angry state, to the perpetration of a violent attack in the name of the ideology. Two teams were combined to analyze radicalization trajectories: data collection and analysis led by Brandeis University and technology development led by Colorado State University (CSU).\\nThe questions revolving around the technological development were as follows: Can tools that rigorously examine and account for the activities of close associates better predict the likelihood that an individual would engage in violent extremism? Which risk assessment indicators for violent extremism in the extant literature are detectable via automated or semi-automated technologies, and what databases and datasets must be integrated to facilitate this detection? Can computationally efficient tools be used to mine these databases for the specific purposes of monitoring and screening for individuals and small groups posing a significant risk for violence?\\nUsers should refer to the data collection notes field below for additional information about study citation.',\n",

Researchers focused\\non the admission of evidence of other acts of violence, known as\\n\"context\" evidence, which characterized the violent relationship\\nbetween the defendant and victim. The design involved a qualitative\\nanalysis of felony trial transcripts in Iowa from 1989 to 1995, in\\nwhich the defendant and victim were involved in a domestic\\nrelationship.

       "  'Description': \"This study evaluated Global Citizen's Forum (GCF), an afterschool youth program designed as a peer gatekeeping program in the area of violent extremism. GCF was implemented in two private high schools in Maryland during spring of 2019. Although the study was designed as a quasi-experimental research with pre/post testing of treatment and control groups, implementation challenges resulted in design problems and a small sample, allowing only for exploratory study. The preliminary results suggest that GCF is associated with some statistically significant gains in participants' knowledge and attitude. The study also presents team's qualitative findings as well as GCF replication framework and financial cost analysis. An assessment of the GCF implementation experience and related observations indicates that GCF may be difficult to replicate due to community sensitivities about accepting the violent extremism threat and the ability of service providers to teach the GCF curriculum. For conclusive and reliable results, this study needs to be replicated with participation of a larger sample.\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'Onsite wastewater disposal systems (OWDS) in coastal regions of Long Island, New York, contribute bacteria, nutrients, and organic wastewater-associated compounds (including pharmaceuticals, personal care and domestic use products referred to here as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs)) to downgradient shallow groundwater in nearshore settings. Many of the densely populated areas along the East Coast (i.e. Long Island, New York) are served by OWDS. Approximately 75 percent of Suffolk County, New York, residents rely on simple OWDS such as a series of cesspools (ground pits lined with cement blocks or rings without a sealed bottom) and septic systems. Cesspools provide minimal wastewater treatment, typically relying on bacteria to breakdown the solid waste while untreated water percolates into the sandy surficial aquifer. The high hydraulic conductivity of the sandy surficial aquifer of the New York coastal region makes these areas particularly vulnerable to organic wastewater contamination. Groundwater samples were collected from the shallow groundwater flow system along the shoreline of (1) a barrier island summer community and (2) the mainland of Long Island. Both locations are distinctive coastal communities in Suffolk County, NY, and typically rely on a simple OWDS system. The coastal communities selected are in areas inundated by the storm tide brought on by Hurricane Sandy and are considered vulnerable to extreme storms (i.e. hurricanes and nor’easters), flooding events, and sea-level rise; all of which can damage wastewater infrastructure and lead to biogeochemical changes that disrupt the level of onsite treatment and result in increased discharge of contaminants to estuaries through groundwater seepage. Specific locations were selected in areas along the shore that are within 180 m downgradient from OWDS and just above the reaches of the spring high-tide mark along the shoreline. For our study, beach areas without bulkheads (a retaining wall built for shoreline protection) were targeted due to the need to access areas downgradient of OWDS. \\nTwenty-nine of the 103 pharmaceuticals measured were detected at least once at the NY sample locations. Other detected CECs include PCDUs (caffeine, nicotine, and metabolites), methyl-1<i>H</i>-benzotrizole (a corrosion inhibitor), and piperonyl butoxide (a pesticide synergist). Lidocaine, an over-the-counter topical anesthetic, was the most commonly detected pharmaceutical (35% of samples). Other commonly detected pharmaceuticals included fexofenadine (an over-the-counter antihistamine detected in 30% of samples), and carbamazepine (an anticonvulsant), desvenlafaxine (antidepressant), meprobamate (an anxiolytic), metformin (an antidiabetic), and tramadol (an opioid) each detected in 25% of the samples.',\n",

A total of 2,000 households in the ZOI were surveyed for the PBS data collection activity. These households are spread across 100 standard enumeration areas in the targeted districts. The survey is comprised of ten CSV files: a children's file, a household-level file, a household member level file, a women's file, several files describing consumption, and two files used to construct the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index.  This file reports household level data from the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI). The WEAI measures the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agriculture sector in an effort to identify and address the constraints that limit women’s full engagement in the agriculture sector.\",\n",

The effects of this combined program, offered in three of\\n the middle schools, were compared to those of just the Project\\n S.T.O.P. program alone in one middle school. To study the program\\n models, researchers used a quasi-experimental pre-post design, with\\n nonequivalent comparison groups. Questionnaires were given to students\\n to assess the impact of the two programs. Students were asked about\\n their knowledge and use of prevention programs in their schools. Data\\n were also collected on students' history of victimization, such as\\n whether they were ever attacked at school, stolen from, mugged, or\\n threatened with a weapon. Students were also asked about their\\n attitudes toward verbal abuse, victims of violence, and conditions\\n when revenge is acceptable, and their exposure to violence, including\\n whether they knew anyone who was sexually abused, beaten, or attacked\\n because of race, gender, or sexual orientation. Additional questions\\n covered students' use of aggressive behaviors, such as whether they\\n had threatened someone with a weapon or had beaten, slapped, hit, or\\n kicked someone. Data were also gathered on the accessibility of\\n alcohol, various drugs, weapons, and stolen property.

Supporting files include an aerial reference image (I395_ref_image.png) and a list of polygon boundaries (I395_boundaries.csv) and associated images (I395_lane-1, I395_lane-2, …, I395_lane-6) stored in a folder titled “Annotation on Regions.zip” to map physical roadway segments to the numerical lane IDs referenced in the trajectory dataset. In the boundary file, columns “x1” to “x5” represent the horizontal pixel values in the reference image, with “x1” being the leftmost boundary line and “x5” being the rightmost boundary line, while the column \"y\" represents corresponding vertical pixel values. The origin point of the reference image is located at the top left corner. The dataset defines five lanes with five boundaries. Lane -6 corresponds to the area to the left of “x1”. Lane -5 corresponds to the area between “x1” and “x2”, and so forth to the rightmost lane, which is defined by the area to the right of “x5” (Lane -2). Lane -1 refers to vehicles that go onto the shoulder of the merging lane (Lane -2), which are manually separated by watching the videos.This dataset was collected as part of the Third Generation Simulation Data (TGSIM): A Closer Look at the Impacts of Automated Driving Systems on Human Behavior project. During the project, six trajectory datasets capable of characterizing human-automated vehicle interactions under a diverse set of scenarios in highway and city environments were collected and processed. For more information, see the project report found here:https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/74647. This dataset, which was one of the six collected as part of the TGSIM project, contains data collected from six 4K cameras mounted on tripods, positioned on three overpasses along I-395 in Washington, D.C. The cameras captured distinct segments of the highway, and their combined overlapping and non-overlapping footage resulted in a continuous trajectory for the entire section covering 0.5 km. This section covers a major weaving/mandatory lane-changing between L\\'Enfant Plaza and 4th Street SW, with three lanes in the eastbound direction and a major on-ramp on the left side. In addition to the on-ramp, the section covers an off-ramp on the right side. The expressway includes one diverging lane at the beginning of the section on the right side and one merging lane in the middle of the section on the left side. For the purposes of data extraction, the shoulder of the merging lane is also considered a travel lane since some vehicles illegally use it as an extended on-ramp to pass other drivers (see I395_ref_image.png for details). The cameras captured continuous footage during the morning rush hour (8:30 AM-10:30 AM ET) on a sunny day. During this period, vehicles equipped with SAE Level 2 automation were deployed to travel through the designated section to capture the impact of SAE Level 2-equipped vehicles on adjacent vehicles and their behavior in congested areas, particularly in complex merging sections. These vehicles are indicated in the dataset.As part of this dataset, the following files were provided:\\nI395-final.csv contains the numerical data to be used for analysis that includes vehicle level trajectory data at every 0.1 second. Vehicle type, width, and length are provided with instantaneous location, speed, and acceleration data. All distance measurements (width, length, location) were converted from pixels to meters using the following conversion factor: 1 pixel = 0.3-meter conversion.\\nI395_ref_image.png is the aerial reference image that defines the geographic region and the associated roadway segments.\\nI395_boundaries.csv contains the coordinates that define the roadway segments (n=X).

This dataset, which is one of the six collected as part of the TGSIM project, contains data collected using one high-resolution 8K camera mounted on a helicopter that followed three SAE Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles (one at a time) northbound through the 4 km long segment at an altitude of 200 meters. Once a vehicle finished the segment, the helicopter would return to the beginning of the segment to follow the next SAE Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicle to ensure continuous data collection. The segment was selected to study mandatory and discretionary lane changing and last-minute, forced lane-changing maneuvers. The segment has five off-ramps and three on-ramps to the right and one off-ramp and one on-ramp to the left. All roads have 88 kph (55 mph) speed limits. The camera captured footage during the evening rush hour (3:00 PM-5:00 PM CT) on a cloudy day.As part of this dataset, the following files were provided:\\nI90_94_moving_final.csv contains the numerical data to be used for analysis that includes vehicle level trajectory data at every 0.1 second. Vehicle size (small or large), width, length, and whether the vehicle was one of the automated test vehicles (\"yes\" or \"no\") are provided with instantaneous location, speed, and acceleration data. All distance measurements (width, length, location) were converted from pixels to meters using the following conversion factor: 1 pixel = 0.3-meter conversion.\\nI90_94_moving_RunX_with_lanes.png are the aerial reference images that define the geographic region and associated roadway segments of interest (see bounding boxes on northbound lanes) for each run X.\\nI-90-moving-Run_X-geometry-with-ramps.csv contain the coordinates that define the lane centerlines for each Run X. The \"x\" and \"y\" columns represent the horizontal and vertical locations in the reference image, respectively. The \"ramp\" columns define the type of roadway segment (0=no ramp, 1=on-ramps, 2=off-ramps, and 3=weaving segments). In total, the centerline files define six northbound lanes.\\nAnnotation on Regions.zip, which includes images that visually map lanes (I90_9',\n",

The MCD64A1 burned-area mapping approach employs 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Surface Reflectance imagery coupled with 1 kilometer (km) MODIS active fire observations. The algorithm uses a burn sensitive Vegetation Index (VI) to create dynamic thresholds that are applied to the composite data. The VI is derived from MODIS shortwave infrared atmospherically corrected surface reflectance bands 5 and 7 with a measure of temporal texture. The algorithm identifies the date of burn for the 500 m grid cells within each individual MODIS tile. The date is encoded in a single data layer as the ordinal day of the calendar year on which the burn occurred with values assigned to unburned land pixels and additional special values reserved for missing data and water grid cells.The data layers provided in the MCD64A1 product include Burn Date, Burn Data Uncertainty, Quality Assurance, along with First Day and Last Day of reliable change detection of the year.Validation at stage 3 (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_val.html) has been achieved for the MODIS Burned Area product. Further details regarding MODIS land product validation for the MCD64A1 data product is available from the MODIS Land Team Validation site (https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/ValStatus.php?ProductID=MOD64).Improvements/Changes from Previous VersionsThe Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).',\n",

These data are essential for regional analysis and decision making, which has become increasingly important as DWR and other state agencies seek to address resource management issues, regulatory compliance issues, environmental impacts, ecosystem services, urban and economic development, and other issues. Increased availability of digital satellite imagery, aerial photography and new analytical tools make remote sensing based land use surveys possible at a field scale that is comparable to that of DWR’s historical on the ground field surveys. Current technologies allow accurate, large-scale crop and land use identification to be performed at desired time increments, and make possible more frequent and comprehensive statewide land use information. Responding to this need, DWR sought expertise and support for identifying crop types and other land uses and quantifying crop acreages statewide using remotely sensed imagery and associated analytical techniques. Currently, Statewide Crop Maps are available for the Water Years 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and PROVISIONALLY for 2022.Historic County Land Use Surveys spanning 1986 - 2015 may also be accessed using the CADWR Land Use Data Viewer:https://gis.water.ca.gov/app/CADWRLandUseViewer.For Regional Land Use Surveys follow:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/region-land-use-surveys.For County Land Use Surveys follow:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/county-land-use-surveys.',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Executive Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that holds promise for tremendous societal and economic benefit. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we live, work, learn, discover, and communicate. AI research can further our national priorities, including increased economic prosperity, improved educational opportunities and quality of life, and enhanced national and homeland security. Because of these potential benefits, the U.S. government has invested in AI research for many years. Yet, as with any significant technology in which the Federal government has interest, there are not only tremendous opportunities but also a number of considerations that must be taken into account in guiding the overall direction of Federally-funded R&D in AI. On May 3, 2016,the Administration announced the formation of a new NSTC Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, to help coordinate Federal activity in AI.1 This Subcommittee, on June 15, 2016, directed the Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) to create a National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan. A NITRD Task Force on Artificial Intelligence was then formed to define the Federal strategic priorities for AI R&D, with particular attention on areas that industry is unlikely to address. This National Artificial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan establishes a set of objectives for Federallyfunded AI research, both research occurring within the government as well as Federally-funded research occurring outside of government, such as in academia. The ultimate goal of this research is to produce new AI knowledge and technologies that provide a range of positive benefits to society, while minimizing the negative impacts. To achieve this goal, this AI R&D Strategic Plan identifies the following priorities for Federally-funded AI research: Strategy 1: Make long-term investments in AI research. Prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a world leader in AI. Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration. Rather than replace humans, most AI systems will collaborate with humans to achieve optimal performance. Research is needed to create effective interactions between humans and AI systems. Strategy 3: Understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. We expect AI technologies to behave according to the formal and informal norms to which we hold our fellow humans. Research is needed to understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and to develop methods for designing AI systems that align with ethical, legal, and societal goals. Strategy 4: Ensure the safety and security of AI systems. Before AI systems are in widespread use, assurance is needed that the systems will operate safely and securely, in a controlled, well-defined, and well-understood manner. Further progress in research is needed to address this challenge of creating AI systems that are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. Strategy 5: Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing. The depth, quality, and accuracy of training datasets and resources significantly affect AI performance. Researchers need to develop high quality datasets and environments and enable responsible access to high-quality datasets as well as to testing and training resources. Strategy 6: Measure and evaluate AI technologies through standards and benchmarks. . Essential to advancements in AI are standards, benchmarks, testbeds, and community engagement that guide and evaluate progress in AI. Additional research is needed to develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques. Strategy 7: Better understand the national AI R&D workforce needs. Advances in AI will require a strong community of AI researchers. An improved understanding of current and future R&D workforce demands in AI is needed to help ensure that sufficient AI experts are available to address the strategic R&D areas outlined in this plan. The AI R&D Strategic Plan closes with two recommendations: Recommendation 1: Develop an AI R&D implementation framework to identify S&T opportunities and support effective coordination of AI R&D investments, consistent with Strategies 1-6 of this plan. Recommendation 2: Study the national landscape for creating and sustaining a healthy AI R&D workforce, consistent with Strategy 7 of this plan.',\n",

       "  'Description': 'Solar Footprints in CaliforniaThis GIS dataset consists of polygons that represent the footprints of solar powered electric generation facilities and related infrastructure in California called Solar Footprints. The location of solar footprints was identified using other existing solar footprint datasets from various sources along with imagery interpretation. CEC staff reviewed footprints identified with imagery and digitized polygons to match the visual extent of each facility. Previous datasets of existing solar footprints used to locate solar facilities include:\\xa0\\xa0GIS Layers: (1) California Solar Footprints,\\xa0(2)\\xa0UC Berkeley Solar Points, (3)\\xa0Kruitwagen et al. 2021, (4)\\xa0BLM Renewable Project Facilities, (5)\\xa0Quarterly Fuel and Energy Report (QFER)Imagery Datasets:\\xa0Esri World Imagery,\\xa0USGS National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), 2020\\xa0SENTINEL 2 Satellite Imagery, 2023Solar facilities with large footprints such as parking lot solar, large rooftop solar, and ground solar were included in the solar footprint dataset. Small scale solar (approximately less than 0.5 acre) and residential footprints were not included. No other data was used in the production of these shapes. Definitions for the solar facilities identified via imagery are subjective and described as follows:\\xa0Rooftop Solar: Solar arrays located on rooftops of large buildings.\\xa0Parking lot Solar: Solar panels on parking lots roughly larger than 1 acre, or clusters of solar panels in adjacent parking lots.\\xa0Ground Solar: Solar panels located on ground roughly larger than 1 acre, or large clusters of smaller scale footprints.\\xa0Once all footprints identified by the above criteria were digitized for all California counties, the features were visually classified into ground, parking and rooftop categories. The features were also classified into rural and urban types using the 42 U.S. Code § 1490 definition for rural. In addition, the distance to the closest substation and the percentile category of this distance (e.g. 0-25th percentile, 25th-50th percentile) was also calculated. The coverage provided by this data set should not be assumed to be a complete accounting of solar footprints in California. Rather, this dataset represents an attempt to improve upon existing solar feature datasets and to update the inventory of \"large\" solar footprints via imagery, especially in recent years since previous datasets were published.\\xa0This procedure produced a total solar project footprint of 150,250\\xa0acres. Attempts to classify these footprints and isolate the large utility-scale projects from the smaller rooftop solar projects identified in the data set is difficult. The data was gathered based on imagery, and project information that could link multiple adjacent solar footprints under one larger project is not known. However, partitioning all solar footprints that are at least partly outside of the techno-economic exclusions and greater than 7 acres yields a total footprint size of 133,493\\xa0acres. These can be approximated as utility-scale footprints.\\xa0\\xa0Metadata:\\xa0(1) CBI Solar FootprintsAbstract: Conservation Biology Institute (CBI) created this dataset of solar footprints in California after it was found that no such dataset was publicly available at the time (Dec 2015-Jan 2016). This dataset is used to help identify where current ground based, mostly utility scale, solar facilities are being constructed and will be used in a larger landscape intactness model to help guide future development of renewable energy projects. The process of digitizing these footprints first began by utilizing an excel file from the California Energy Commission with lat/long coordinates of some of the older and bigger locations. After projecting those points and locating the facilities utilizing NAIP 2014 imagery, the developed area around each facility was digitized. While interpreting imagery, there were some instances where a fenced perimeter was clearly seen and was slightly larger than the actual footprint. For those cases the footprint followed the fenced perimeter since it limits wildlife movement through the area. In other instances, it was clear that the top soil had been scraped of any vegetation, even outside of the primary facility footprint. These footprints included the areas that were scraped within the fencing since, especially in desert systems, it has been near permanently altered.\\xa0Other sources that guided the search for solar facilities included the Energy Justice Map, developed by the Energy Justice Network which can be found here:https://www.energyjustice.net/map/searchobject.php?gsMapsize=large&amp;giCurrentpageiFacilityid;=1&amp;gsTable;=facility&amp;gsSearchtype;=advancedTheSolar Energy Industries Association’s “Project Location Map” which can be found here:https://www.seia.org/map/majorprojectsmap.phpalsoassisted in locating newer facilities along with the \"Power Plants\" shapefile, updated in December 16th, 2015, downloaded from the U.S. Energy Information Administration located here:https://www.eia.gov/maps/layer_info-m.cfmTherewere some facilities that were stumbled upon while searching for others, most of these are smaller scale sites located near farm infrastructure. Other sites were located by contacting counties that had solar developments within the county. Still, others were located by sleuthing around for proposals and company websites that had images of the completed facility. These helped to locate the most recently developed sites and these sites were digitized based on landmarks such as ditches, trees, roads and other permanent structures.Metadata:\\xa0(2)\\xa0UC Berkeley Solar PointsUC Berkeley report containing\\xa0point location for energy facilities across the United States.2022_utility-scale_solar_data_update.xlsm (live.com)Metadata:\\xa0(3)\\xa0Kruitwagen et al. 2021Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy generating capacity has grown by 41 per cent per year\\xa0since 2009.

The GIS data is developed with the cooperation of the United States Forest Service Region 5, the Bureau of Land Management, California State Parks, National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and is released in the spring with added data from the previous calendar year. Although the dataset represents the most complete digital record of fire perimeters in California, it is still incomplete, and users should be cautious when drawing conclusions based on the data.\\xa0\\xa0This data should be used carefully for statistical analysis and reporting due to missing perimeters\\xa0(see Use Limitation in metadata).\\xa0Some fires are missing because historical records were lost or damaged, were too small for the minimum cutoffs, had inadequate documentation or have not yet been incorporated into the database. Other errors with the fire perimeter database include duplicate fires and over-generalization. Additionally, over-generalization, particularly with large old fires, may show unburned \"islands\" within the final perimeter as burned. Users of the fire perimeter database must exercise caution in application of the data. Careful use of the fire perimeter database will prevent users from drawing inaccurate or erroneous conclusions from the data. This data is updated annually in the spring with fire perimeters from the previous fire season.\\xa0This dataset may differ\\xa0in California compared to that available from the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)\\xa0due to different requirements between the two datasets.\\xa0The data covers fires back to 1878.\\xa0\\xa0As of May 2024, it represents fire23_1.\\xa0Please help improve this dataset by filling out this survey with feedback:Historic Fire Perimeter Dataset Feedback (arcgis.com)Current criteria for data collection are as follows:CAL FIRE (including contract counties) submit perimeters ≥10 acres in timber, ≥50 acres in brush, or ≥300 acres in grass, and/or ≥3 impacted residential or commercial structures, and/or caused ≥1 fatality.All cooperating agencies submit perimeters ≥10 acres.Version update:Firep23_1 was released in May 2024.

       "  'Description': 'NUOnet Vision: Efficient use of nutrients to optimize production and product quality of food for animals and humans, fuel and fiber in a sustainable manner that contributes to ecosystem services. This record contains the DET and Data Dictionary for NUOnet - the data files may be found athttps://usdaars.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=e90392a99d5c427487c6c37cf6d47844Best nutrient management practices are critical for maintaining profitable economic returns, sustaining higher yields, lowering environmental impacts, optimizing nutritional quality, and providing ecosystem services. Best management practices that improve nutrient use efficiencies can reduce nutrient losses from agricultural systems. However, we need to improve our understanding of biological, physical and chemical influences on nutrient processes. For instance, crop use efficiency of nitrogen (N), the primary macronutrient regulating yield and protein content, can be reduced by processes such as denitrification (N2O and N2 emission), leaching (NH4-N, NO3-N, and organic-N), ammonia (NH3-N,) volatilization, surface runoff and erosion, disease, and non-crop competition. Similarly, we need to obtain more information about biological and physical cycles of nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), including factors that influence nutrient availability from fertilizers, crop residues, cover crops, manures, and other byproducts. We need a better understanding of relationships between soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates, and availability and uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients.  In addition, we need information regarding how these practices impact yields, organoleptic qualities, and the macro- and micro-nutritional composition of plants.  This information will improve our ability to develop best nutrient management practices.\\nOptimal soil nutrient levels are critical for maximizing economic returns, increasing sustainable yields, lowering environmental impacts, sustaining ecosystem services and optimizing nutritional and organoleptic qualities of human and animal foods. Efficient management practices are crucial for increasing economic returns for land managers in a sustainable manner while producing high quality of food for animals and humans with reduced off-site transfer of nutrients from agricultural areas in watersheds. Optimizing N and P inputs requires more information about nutrient inputs from fertilizers, manures, composts, agricultural byproducts, cover crops, and other nutrient sources in addition to nutrient cycling within soils.  This requires data from long-term nutrient management studies across a wide range of soils, crops, and environmental conditions. Land management needs are to connect nutrient management practices for crops with nutrient use efficiency; crop quality; crop chemical composition and nutritional value, quality and acceptability for animal and human health.  Development of databases that enable the scientific exploration of connections among data generated from diverse research efforts such as nutrient management, fate and ecosystem service outcomes, nutritional composition of crops, and animal and human health, is needed.\\nNitrogen is a key nutrient that enhances agricultural yield and protein content, but multiple N loss pathways, as previously mentioned, reduce crop N use efficiency (NUE). Implementing proper management practices is needed to reduce N losses from agricultural systems. ARS has multidisciplinary scientific teams with expertise in soils, ecological engineering, hydrology, livestock management and nutrition, horticulture, crop breeding, human and animal nutrition, post-harvest management and processing, and other areas, and intentional collaboration among these teams offers opportunities to rapidly improve NUE and crop quality and reduce off-site N losses. \\nSimilarly, increased P use efficiencies are needed to enhance and ensure sustainable agricultural production and to reduce environmental degradation of water sources. Manure is a valuable source of P and it can be used as a soil amendment to reduce crop production costs. However, there is a need to improve our understanding of the biological and physical cycles of soil P, as well as to obtain more information about P supplies from fertilizer, crop residues, cover crops, manure, and byproducts, and livestock nutrition impacts on manure properties.\\nThere is also a need for a better understanding of soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates and how their interactions with crops and community ecology affect yield and the uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients and the ultimate nutritional composition and organoleptic qualities of the crop. Studies documenting the responses of crop-associated biological communities to management practices and genetic technologies implemented across multiple environments (e.g., soil types and chemistries, hydrologic regimes, climates) will improve our understanding of gaps in macro- and micro-nutrient management strategies.\\nA goal of the USDA-ARS is to increase agricultural production and quality while reducing environmental impacts. The Nutrient Uptake and Outcomes (NUOnet) database will be able to help establish baselines on nutrient use efficiencies; processes contributing to nutrient losses; and processes contributing to optimal crop yield, nutritional and organoleptic quality. This national database could be used to calculate many different environmental indicators from a comprehensive understanding of nutrient stocks and flows. Increasing our understanding of stocks and flows could help in the identification of knowledge gaps as well as areas where increased efficiencies can be achieved at a national level. NUOnet could also be used to develop tools to derive cost-benefit curves associated with nutrient management improvement scenarios and assess local, regional and national impacts of off-site nutrient loss. Understanding how agricultural production impacts human health is a challenge, and the database could be used to link crop management strategies to crop chemical composition to human consumption patterns and ultimately to human health outcomes. A national database will also be very important for development and evaluation of new technologies such as real-time sensing or other proximal and remote sensing technologies that enable assessment of nutrient use efficiencies, particularly at the grower level. The database could also be used to develop analyses that will contribute to the recommendation of policies for resource allocations that will most effectively fulfill the goals of the Grand Challenge. Such a national database with contributions from peers across different national programs could also enhance collaborations between ARS, universities, and extension specialists, as well as with producers, industry, and other partners.\\nSee the NUOnet Home Page for more information about this database and strategic goals.\\nResources in thisdataset:ResourceTitle: GRACEnet-NUOnet Data Dictionary.

       "  'Description': 'The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Downloadable Data Collection from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go tohttps://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography.DWR was the steward for NHD and Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in California. We worked with other organizations to edit and improve NHD and WBD, using the business rules for California. California\\'s NHD improvements were sent to USGS for incorporation into the national database. The most up-to-date products are accessible from the USGS website. Please note that the California portion of the National Hydrography Dataset is appropriate for use at the 1:24,000 scale.For additional derivative products and resources, including the major features in geopackage format, please go to this page:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-major-featuresArchives of previous statewide extracts of the NHD going back to 2018 may be found athttps://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-archive.In September 2022, USGS officially notified DWR that the NHD would become static as USGS resources will be devoted to the transition to the new 3D Hydrography Program (3DHP). 3DHP will consist of LiDAR-derived hydrography at a higher resolution than NHD. Upon completion, 3DHP data will be easier to maintain, based on a modern data model and architecture, and better meet the requirements of users that were documented in the Hydrography Requirements and Benefits Study (2016). The initial releases of 3DHP will be the NHD data cross-walked into the 3DHP data model. It will take several years for the 3DHP to be built out for California. Please refer to the resources on this page for more information.The FINAL,STATIC version of the National Hydrography Dataset for California was published for download by USGS on December 27, 2023.

Entering its second century, the National Wildlife Refuge System comprises 150 million acres, protected within more than 565 Refuges and thousands of small prairie wetlands that serve as waterfowl breeding and nesting areas. There are wildlife refuges in every State, and at least one within an hour's drive of every major American city, providing refuge for people as well as wildlife. National Wildlife Refuges are far more than havens for wild plants and animals. In fact, visitors–more than 40 million each year–are welcome on 98 percent of wildlife refuges, where they are encouraged to take part in outdoor pursuits designated by law as priority activities offered by the National Wildlife Refuge System. From environmental education and interpretation to hunting and fishing to photography and wildlife watching, refuges offer visitors the most natural and wild outdoor experience, teaching millions the importance of taking care of our natural resources. This map shows the lands and waters managed by the National Wildlife Refuge System. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is a Federal Agency whose mission, working with others, is to conserve fish and wildlife and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'This EnviroAtlas dataset contains species richness metrics based on habitat models generated by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Gap Analysis Project (GAP). Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 24 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrate species. Metrics include all species richness, taxa specific species richness and other lists identifying species of conservation concern, climate vulnerabilities, etc. This dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University, US EPA, and USGS to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

       "  'Description': \"The 2016 Recycling Economic Information (REI) Report aims to increase the understanding of the economic implications of material reuse and recycling. The report shows that recycling and reuse of materials creates jobs, while also generating local and state tax revenues.   The 2016 REI Report covers the economic activities of nine sectors: ferrous metals, nonferrous metals (aluminum), glass, paper, plastics, rubber, construction and demolition, electronics and organics (including food and yard trimmings).The 2016 REI Report builds on work from a 2001 REI study. In 2001, to encourage the development of an economic market for recycling, EPA supported the creation of a national Recycling Economic Information (REI) Project and the related REI report, based upon the work of several states and regions. The REI report was a ground breaking national study demonstrating the economic value of recycling and reuse to the U.S. economy. Compiled through a cooperative agreement with the National Recycling Coalition, the study confirmed what many have known for decades: there are significant economic benefits in recycling.  The 2016 report focuses on the economic impacts of recycling rather than the environmental benefits, as the environmental benefits have been researched in detail. Accurately estimating the impact that recycling has on jobs, wages and taxes is important because the results can influence policy decisions and provide a more robust picture of recycling by adding an economic layer on top of the more heavily researched environmental impacts of recycling. For more information, please visithttps://www.epa.gov/smm/recycling-economic-information-rei-report.The REI Report is part of EPA's larger SMM program (https://www.epa.gov/smm). Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) is a systemic approach to using and reusing materials more productively over their entire lifecycles. It represents a change in how our society thinks about the use of natural resources and environmental protection. By looking at a product's entire lifecycle we can find new opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources and reduce costs. There are multiple challenge programs available as part of the SMM program, including the Food Recovery Challenge, the Electronics Challenge, the Federal Green Challenge and the WasteWise program.\",\n",

The GIS data is developed with the cooperation of the United States Forest Service Region 5, the Bureau of Land Management, California State Parks, National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and is released in the spring with added data from the previous calendar year. Although the dataset represents the most complete digital record of fire perimeters in California, it is still incomplete, and users should be cautious when drawing conclusions based on the data.\\xa0\\xa0This data should be used carefully for statistical analysis and reporting due to missing perimeters\\xa0(see Use Limitation in metadata).\\xa0Some fires are missing because historical records were lost or damaged, were too small for the minimum cutoffs, had inadequate documentation or have not yet been incorporated into the database. Other errors with the fire perimeter database include duplicate fires and over-generalization. Additionally, over-generalization, particularly with large old fires, may show unburned \"islands\" within the final perimeter as burned. Users of the fire perimeter database must exercise caution in application of the data. Careful use of the fire perimeter database will prevent users from drawing inaccurate or erroneous conclusions from the data. This data is updated annually in the spring with fire perimeters from the previous fire season.\\xa0This dataset may differ\\xa0in California compared to that available from the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)\\xa0due to different requirements between the two datasets.\\xa0The data covers fires back to 1878.\\xa0\\xa0As of May 2024, it represents fire23_1.\\xa0Please help improve this dataset by filling out this survey with feedback:Historic Fire Perimeter Dataset Feedback (arcgis.com)Current criteria for data collection are as follows:CAL FIRE (including contract counties) submit perimeters ≥10 acres in timber, ≥50 acres in brush, or ≥300 acres in grass, and/or ≥3 impacted residential or commercial structures, and/or caused ≥1 fatality.All cooperating agencies submit perimeters ≥10 acres.Version update:Firep23_1 was released in May 2024.

As a use-of-force method, however, OC spray has been alleged in\\n the media to have been associated with a number of in-custody\\n deaths. The goal of this study was to assess the safety of a\\n commercially available OC spray in use by law enforcement agencies\\n nationwide. The study was conducted as a randomized, cross-over,\\n controlled trial on volunteer human subjects recruited from the local\\n law enforcement training academy in San Diego County,\\n California. Subjects participated in four different experimental\\n trials in random order over two separate days in a pulmonary function\\n testing laboratory: (a) placebo spray exposure followed by sitting\\n position, (b) placebo spray exposure followed by restraint position,\\n (c) OC spray exposure followed by sitting position, and (d) OC spray\\n exposure followed by restraint position. Prior to participation,\\n subjects completed a short questionnaire regarding their health\\n status, history of lung disease and asthma, smoking history,\\n medication use, and respiratory inhaler medication use. Prior to\\n exposure, subjects also underwent a brief screening spirometry in the\\n sitting position by means of a portable spirometry device to determine\\n baseline pulmonary function. Subjects then placed their heads in a 5'\\n x 3' x 3' exposure box that allowed their faces to be exposed to the\\n spray. A one-second spray was delivered into the box from the end\\n opposite the subject (approximately five feet away). Subjects remained\\n in the box for five seconds after the spray was delivered. During this\\n time, subjects underwent impedance monitoring to assess whether\\n inhalation of the OC or placebo spray had occurred. After this\\n exposure period, subjects were placed in either the sitting or prone\\n maximal restraint position. Subjects remained in these positions for\\n ten minutes. Repeat spirometric measurements were performed, oxygen\\n saturation, blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, and pulse\\n rate were recorded, and an arterial blood sample was drawn. A total of\\n 34 subjects completed the study, comprising 128 separate analyzable\\n study trials. Variables provided in all three parts of this collection\\n include subject's age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass\\n index, past medical history, tobacco use history, and history of\\n medication use, as well as OC spray or placebo exposure and sitting or\\n restraint position during the trial. Part 1 also includes tidal\\n volume, respiratory rate, and heart rate at baseline and at 1, 5, 7,\\n and 9 minutes, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline\\n and at 3, 6, and 9 minutes. Additional variables in Part 2 include\\n predicted forced vital capacity and predicted forced expiratory volume\\n in 1 second, and the same measures at baseline, 1.5 minutes, and 10\\n minutes. Derived variables include percent predicted and mean percent\\n predicted values involving the above variables. Part 3 also provides\\n end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygenation levels, oxygen saturation,\\n oxygen consumption at baseline and at 1, 5, 7, and 9 minutes, blood\\n pH, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide\\nat 8 minutes.\",\n",

The purpose\\nof this project was to update the benchmark findings from an earlier\\nsurvey of Vermont residents in 1994, to assess public attitudes about\\nthe reforms and changes that had been instituted by the Vermont DOC,\\nand to explore the possibility of expansion of responsibilities of the\\nreparative community boards. This project involved a telephone survey\\nof a new sample of 601 adult residents of Vermont. The interviewing\\nwas conducted on March 15-21, 1999. Respondents were asked a series of\\ntrend questions to update the 1994 findings. Respondents were also\\nasked questions about two other programs: the diversion program, in\\nwhich selected first offenders who fulfilled the terms of a\\ncommunity-based sanction could have their records expunged, and the\\nfurlough program, in which offenders making the transition from prison\\nto the community were supervised for an interim period. The survey\\nalso explored whether Vermonters would like to see the\\nresponsibilities of the reparative boards expanded to include\\ncommunity notification and other types of cases. Residents assessed\\nwhether crime in general, violent crime, and illegal drug use had\\nincreased compared to five years prior, whether more prisons should be\\nbuilt, whether Vermont\\'s jails and prisons were overcrowded, and\\nwhether violent offenders were being released before completing their\\nsentences because of overcrowding. They commented on how often\\noffenders in four scenarios should go to prison and how often they\\nbelieved that these offenders in fact did go to prison. Respondents\\nrated the performance of various segments of the Vermont criminal\\njustice system and, given 15 offense scenarios, were asked whether the\\noffender should spend time in jail or in community service and\\nrehabilitation. In addition, respondents were asked whether anyone in\\ntheir household had been a victim of a crime within the last three\\nyears and, if so, whether it was a violent crime. Demographic data\\ninclude sex, employment, education, race/ethnicity, and age category\\nof the respondent, and the county and region where the resident\\nlived.',\n",

The dilemma\\n associated with community notification is balancing the public\\'s\\n right to be informed with the need to successfully reintegrate\\n offenders within the community. Wisconsin was one of the 50 state\\n jurisdictions that enacted a sex offender community notification\\n statute. This project was an in-depth study of that state\\'s experience\\n from the vantage point of several groups affected by the community\\n notification process. This data collection contains three surveys that\\n were conducted from January 1998 through mid-September 1998: (1) a\\n survey of 704 neighborhood residents at 22 community notification\\n meetings throughout the state (Part 1), (2) a statewide survey of 312\\n police and sheriff agencies (Part 2), and (3) a statewide survey of\\n 128 probation and parole agents and their supervisors from units with\\n sex offender caseloads (Part 3). Variables in Part 1 include how\\n respondents found out about the date and place of the community\\n notification meeting, respondents\\' opinions of the purpose of the\\n meeting, how clearly the purpose of meeting was stated, how the\\n meeting went, outcomes, rating of information presented, if materials\\n were handed out, if the materials were helpful, and respondents\\' level\\n of concern after the meeting. Enforcement agency data (Part 2) include\\n variables such as type of agency, type of jurisdiction, population\\n size, if the agency designated a special staff member to coordinate\\n the sex offender registration and notification functions, if the\\n agency had policies regarding registration of sex offenders and\\n community notification about sex offenders, if the agency attended\\n statewide training, who participated in the Core Notification Team,\\n what kind of information was used to determine a sex offender\\'s risk\\n to the community, which agencies registered to receive notice, and if\\n the agency planned to update or expand their notification list.\\n Additional variables cover the number of requests for information from\\n Neighborhood Watch Programs, what identifying information about the\\n offender the agency released, types of communication the agency\\n received from the public after a notification had been issued, topics\\n discussed in the public communication to the agency, benefits of the\\n community notification law, difficulties in carrying out the\\n requirements of the law, and methods developed to handle the\\n problems.

       "  'Description': \"The main focus of this research was on identifying the\\n conditions under which public support for rehabilitation varies. A\\n single, multivariate analysis method was used so that the influence of\\n each respondent, criminal, crime, and treatment characterististic\\n could be determined within the context of all other factors. The\\n research also explored differences between global and specific\\n attitudes toward rehabilitation. Data for this study were collected\\n through a mail survey of 1,000 Ohio residents (Part 1). The initial\\n mailing was sent to all 1,000 members of the sample on May 28,\\n 1996. Several followups were conducted, and data collection efforts\\n ended on August 26, 1996. Questionnaire items elicited demographic,\\n experiential, and attitudinal information from each respondent. To\\n assess the potential influence of offender, offense, and treatment\\n characteristics on the respondent's support for rehabilitation,\\n several variables were combined to create a factorial vignette. This\\n method allowed the independent effects of each factor on support for\\n rehabilitation to be determined. The respondents were asked to express\\n their agreement or disagreement with five statements following the\\n vignette: (1) general support for rehabilitation, (2) effectiveness of\\n intervention, (3) basing release decisions on progress in\\n rehabilitation programs, (4) individualizing sentences to fit\\n treatment needs, and (5) expanding treatment opportunities for\\n offenders. Types of offenses included in the vignettes were robbery,\\n burglary, aggravated assault, larceny, motor vehicle theft, fraud,\\n drug sales, and drug use. These offenses were selected since they are\\n well-known to the public, offenders are arrested for these offenses\\n fairly frequently, and the offenses are potentially punishable by a\\n sentence of either prison or probation. Several attributes within the\\n particular offenses in the vignettes were designed to assess the\\n influence of different levels of harm, either financial or\\n physical. Offender characteristics and offense selection for use in\\n the vignettes were weighted by their frequency of arrests as reported\\n in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1995 Uniform Crime Report\\n data. A rating of the seriousness of each offense was assigned using a\\n separate survey of 118 undergraduate university students (Part 2), and\\n the resulting seriousness score was used in the analysis of the\\n vignettes. Additional items on the mail survey instrument assessed the\\n respondent's global and specific attitudes toward\\n treatment. Independent variables from the mail survey include the\\n respondent's age, education, income category, sex, race, political\\n party, rating of political conservativism, personal contact with\\n offenders, religious identity salience, religiosity, attitudes toward\\n biblical literalness and religious forgiveness, fear of crime, and\\n victimization. Variables from the vignettes examined whether support\\n for rehabilitation was influenced by offender age, race, sex, type of\\n offense committed, employment status, substance use, prior record,\\n sentence, and treatment program. Global support for rehabilitation was\\n measured by responses to two questions: what the respondent thought\\n the main emphasis in most prisons was (to punish, to rehabilitate, to\\n protect society), and what the main emphasis should be. Items assessed\\n variations in the respondent's attitudes toward rehabilitation by\\n offender's age, sex, and prior record, location of treatment, and the\\n type of treatment provided. Variables from the crime seriousness\\n survey recorded the respondent's rating of various crime events,\\n including assault and robbery (with or without a weapon, with varying\\n degrees of injury, or no injury to the victim), burglary, larceny, and\\n auto theft (with varying values of the property stolen), drug dealing,\\ndrug use, and writing bad checks.\",\n",

       "  'Description': 'This study was designed to analyze the impact of four\\n televised public service announcements (PSAs) aired for three months\\n in Lima, Ohio. The researchers sought to answer three specific\\n research questions: (1) Were the PSAs effective in transferring\\n knowledge to citizens about the police? (2) Did the PSAs have an\\n impact on resident satisfaction with the police? and (3) Did the PSAs\\n have an impact on the behavior of citizens interacting with the\\n police? To assess public attitudes about the Lima police and to\\n determine whether the substance of the PSAs was being communicated to\\n the residents of Lima, three waves of telephone interviews were\\n conducted (Part 1). The first telephone interviews were conducted in\\n April 1996 with approximately 500 randomly selected Lima\\n residents. These were baseline interviews that took place before the\\n PSAs aired. The survey instrument used in the first interview assessed\\n resident satisfaction with the police and the services they\\n provided. After completion of the Wave 1 interviews, the PSAs were\\n aired on television for three months (June 5-August 28, 1996). After\\n August 28, the PSAs were removed from general circulation. A second\\n wave of telephone interviews was conducted in September 1996 with a\\n different group of randomly selected Lima residents. The same survey\\n instrument used during the first interviews was administered during\\n the second wave, with additional questions added relating to whether\\n the respondent saw any of the PSAs. A third group of randomly selected\\n Lima residents was contacted via the telephone in January 1997 for the\\n final wave of interviews. The final interviews utilized the identical\\n survey instrument used during Wave 2. The focus of this follow-up\\n survey was on citizen retention, over time, of the information\\n communicated in the PSAs. Official data collected from computerized\\n records maintained by the Lima Police Department were also collected\\n to monitor changes in citizen behavior (Part 2). The records data span\\n 127 weeks, from January 1, 1995, to June 7, 1997, which includes 74\\n weeks of pre-PSA data and 53 weeks of data for the period during the\\n initial airing of the first PSA and thereafter. Variables in Part 1\\n include whether respondents were interested in learning about what to\\n do if stopped by the police, what actions they had displayed when\\n stopped by the police, if they would defend another person being\\n treated unfairly by the police, how responsible they felt (as a\\n citizen) in preventing crimes, the likelihood of calling the police if\\n they were aware of a crime, perception of crime and fear of crime, and\\n whether there had been an increase or decrease in the level of crime\\n in their neighborhoods. Respondents were also asked about the amount\\n of television they watched, whether they saw any of the public service\\n announcements and if so to rate them, whether the PSAs provided\\n information not already known, whether any of the PSA topics had come\\n up in conversations with family or friends, and whether the\\n respondent would like to see more PSAs in the future. Finally,\\n respondents were asked whether the police were doing as much as they\\n could to make the neighborhood safe, how responsive the police were to\\n nonemergency matters, and to rate their overall satisfaction with the\\n Lima Police Department and its various services. Demographic variables\\n for Part 1 include the race, gender, age, marital status, level of\\n education, employment status, and income level of each respondent.\\n Variables in Part 2 cover police use-of-force or resisting arrest\\n incidents that took place during the study period, whether the PSA\\n aired during the week in which a use-of-force or resisting arrest\\n incident took place, the number of supplemental police use-of-force\\n reports that were made, and the number of resisting arrest charges\\nmade.',\n",

       "  'Description': 'This data collection was designed to evaluate the\\n implementation of community policing initiatives for three police\\n departments in Jefferson County, West Virginia: the Ranson Town Police\\n Department, the West Virginia State Police (Jefferson County\\n Detachment), and the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Department. The\\n evaluation was undertaken by the Free Our Citizens of Unhealthy\\n Substances Coalition (FOCUS), a county-based group of citizens who\\n represented all segments of the community, including businesses,\\n churches, local law enforcement agencies, and local governments. The\\n aim was to find answers to the following questions: (1) Can community\\n policing have any detectable and measurable impact in a predominantly\\n rural setting? (2) Did the police department do what they said they\\n would do in their funding application? (3) If they were successful,\\n what factors supported their efforts and were key to their success?\\n and (4) If they were not successful, what problems prevented their\\n success? The coalition conducted citizen surveys to evaluate how much\\n of an impact community policing initiatives had in their county. In\\n January 1996, research assistants conducted a baseline survey of 300\\n households in the county. Survey responses were intended to gauge\\n residents\\' fear of crime and to assess how well the police were\\n performing their duties. After one year, the coalition repeated its\\n survey of public attitudes, and research assistants interviewed\\n another 300 households. The research assumption was that any change in\\n fear of crime or assessment of police performance could reasonably be\\n attributed to these new community policing inventions. Crime reporting\\n variables from the survey included which crime most concerned the\\n respondent, if the respondent would report a crime he or she observed,\\n and whether the respondent would testify about the crime in\\n court. Variables pertaining to level of concern for specific crimes\\n include how concerned respondents were that someone would rob or\\n attack them, break into or vandalize their home, or try to sexually\\n attack them/someone they cared about. Community involvement variables\\n covered participation in community groups or activities, neighborhood\\n associations, church, or informal social activities. Police/citizen\\n interaction variables focused on the number of times respondents had\\n called to report a problem to the police in the last two years, how\\n satisfied they were with how the police handled the problem, the\\n extent to which this police department needed improvement, whether\\n children trusted law enforcement officers, whether police needed to\\n respond more quickly to calls, whether the police needed improved\\n relations with the community, and in the past year whether local\\n police performance had improved/gotten worse. Specific crime\\n information variables include whether the crime occurred in the\\n respondent\\'s neighborhood, whether he/she was the victim, if crime was\\n serious in the respondent\\'s neighborhood versus elsewhere, whether the\\n respondent had considered moving as a result of crime in the\\n neighborhood, and how personal safety had changed in the respondent\\'s\\n neighborhood. Variables relating to community policing include whether\\n the respondent had heard the term \"community policing\" in the past\\n year, from what source, and what community policing activities the\\n respondent was aware of. Demographic variables include job\\n self-classification, racial/ethnic identity, length of residency, age,\\n gender, martial status, educational status, and respondent\\'s town of\\nresidence.',\n",

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.\\n    Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes sex, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition. This study has 1 Data Set.',\n",

The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\".

These activities come from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) published standard, along with the information security and customer privacy controls it references (NIST 800 Series Special Publications). The Framework Core presents industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner that allows for communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the organization from the executive level to the implementation/operations level.\\xa0\\xa0The Framework Core consists of five concurrent and continuous functions – identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.\\xa0 When considered together, these functions provide a high-level, strategic view of the lifecycle of an organization’s management of cybersecurity risk.\\xa0 The Framework Core identifies underlying key categories and subcategories for each function, and matches them with example references, such as existing standards, guidelines and practices for each subcategory.\\xa0This page provides data for the Cybersecurity performance measure.Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) scores by each CSF category per fiscal year quarter (Performance Measure 5.12)The performance measure dashboard is available at\\xa05.12 Cybersecurity.Additional InformationSource: Maturity assessment /https://www.nist.gov/topics/cybersecurityContact:Scott CampbellContact E-Mail: Scott_Campbell@tempe.govData Source Type: ExcelPreparation Method: The data is a summary of a detailed and confidential analysis of the city's cyber security program.

Specific drugs were identified using methods for searching literal text from death certificates.The provisional data are based on a current flow of mortality data and include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of drug overdose deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence and specified drug. Provisional drug overdose death counts presented on this page are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2022 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2021 and June 2022), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods. It is important to note that the data represent counts of deaths, and not mortality ratios or rates, which are the standard measure used to compare groups, and therefore should not be used to determine populations at disproportionate risk of drug overdose death.',\n",

Agencies are dispatched via a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system. This dataset contains dispatched EMS and Fire events from the CAD and includes details about the nature of the emergency.To protect the privacy of callers and prevent sensitive health or other identifying information being revealed, the following steps were taken:Aggregated event location to census block groups.Aggregated call date/time to quarter and year.Shortened call types to remove potentially identifying information.Flagged certain call types as containing sensitive health information, such as mental health issues, overdose, etc.Checked frequency of calls with sensitive health information:If the number of calls (in a particular category related to sensitive health information) for a certain quarter/year and census block group was greater than or equal to 5, the call description was included.If less than 5, the call description was redacted.Events requiring EMS and Fire services will appear in both datasets with a different Call ID. Events requiring two agencies of the same service (e.g. two or more different fire companies responded to a major fire) will only list the primary responder.The call descriptions are based on information provided by the caller. The calls are not later updated with a disposition or correction if the original description was inaccurate. For example, if EMS is dispatched to the scene of a stroke, but the person actually had a heart attack, that record would not be updated later with the correct description.A small subset of the CAD data had no call type recorded. These records are preserved with a \"null\" in the Description_Short field. Redacted call types are listed as \"Removed\".The 19 municipalities that dispatch their own EMS, Fire, and/or Police services are called \"ringdown municipalities\". These are subject to change.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2014 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes sex, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.\\nThis study has 1 Data Set.',\n",

PAD-US is the nation\\'s inventory of protected areas, including public land and voluntarily provided private protected areas. Starting with version 1.4 PAD-US was identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastre Theme (https://ngda-cadastre-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/). The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. \\'Wilderness Area\\'), Executive (e.g. \\'National Monument\\'), and administrative designations (e.g. \\'Area of Critical Environmental Concern\\') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling \"best available\" data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory.For more information regarding the PAD-US dataset please visit,https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/protected-areas/.

The QCEW program produces a comprehensive tabulation of employment and wage information for workers covered by California Unemployment Insurance (UI) laws and Federal workers covered by the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program.The QCEW program serves as a near census of monthly employment and quarterly wage information by 6-digit industry codes from the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the national, state, and county levels. At the national level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data for nearly every NAICS industry. At the state and local area level, the QCEW program publishes employment and wage data down to the 6-digit NAICS industry level, if disclosure restrictions are met. In accordance with the BLS policy, data provided to the Bureau in confidence are used only for specified statistical purposes and are not published. The BLS withholds publication of Unemployment Insurance law-covered employment and wage data for any industry level when necessary to protect the identity of cooperating employers.Data from the QCEW program serve as an important input to many BLS programs. The Current Employment Statistics and the Occupational Employment Statistics programs use the QCEW data as the benchmark source for employment. The UI administrative records collected under the QCEW program serve as a sampling frame for the BLS establishment surveys.In addition, the data serve as an input to other federal and state programs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce uses the QCEW data as the base for developing the wage and salary component of personal income.The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and California's EDD use the QCEW data to administer the Unemployment Insurance program. The QCEW data accurately reflect the extent of coverage of California’s UI laws and are used to measure UI revenues; national, state and local area employment; and total and UI taxable wage trends.The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes new QCEW data in its County Employment and Wages news release on a quarterly basis. The BLS also publishes a subset of its quarterly data through the Create Customized Tables system, and full quarterly industry detail data at all geographic levels.\",\n",

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation.

The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2015 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the county level.

       "  'Description': 'OverviewThe Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the U.S. Department of State produces the Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB) dataset.  The current edition is version 11.4 (published 24 February 2025).  The 11.4 release contains updated boundary lines and data refinements designed to extend the functionality of the dataset.  These data and generalized derivatives are the only international boundary lines approved for U.S. Government use.  The contents of this dataset reflect U.S. Government policy on international boundary alignment, political recognition, and dispute status.  They do not necessarily reflect de facto limits of control.National Geospatial Data AssetThis dataset is a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDAID 194) managed by the Department of State.  It is a part of the International Boundaries Theme created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.Dataset Source DetailsSources for these data include treaties, relevant maps, and data from boundary commissions, as well as national mapping agencies.  Where available and applicable, the dataset incorporates information from courts, tribunals, and international arbitrations.  The research and recovery process includes analysis of satellite imagery and elevation data.  Due to the limitations of source materials and processing techniques, most lines are within 100 meters of their true position on the ground.Cartographic VisualizationThe LSIB is a geospatial dataset that, when used for cartographic purposes, requires additional styling. The LSIB download package contains example style files for commonly used software applications.  The attribute table also contains embedded information to guide the cartographic representation.  Additional discussion of these considerations can be found in the Use of Core Attributes in Cartographic Visualization section below.Additional cartographic information pertaining to the depiction and description of international boundaries or areas of special sovereignty can be found in Guidance Bulletins published by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues:https://hiu.state.gov/data/cartographic_guidance_bulletins/ContactDirect inquiries to internationalboundaries@state.gov.Direct download:https://data.geodata.state.gov/LSIB.zipAttribute StructureThe dataset uses the following attributes divided into two categories:\\nATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTRIBUTE STATUS \\nCC1 | Core\\nCC1_GENC3 | Extension\\nCC1_WPID | Extension\\nCOUNTRY1 | Core\\nCC2 | Core\\nCC2_GENC3 | Extension\\nCC2_WPID | Extension\\nCOUNTRY2 | Core\\nRANK | Core\\nLABEL | Core\\nSTATUS | Core\\nNOTES | Core\\nLSIB_ID | Extension\\nANTECIDS | Extension\\nPREVIDS | Extension\\nPARENTID | Extension\\nPARENTSEG | ExtensionThese attributes have external data sources that update separately from the LSIB:\\nATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTRIBUTE STATUS \\nCC1 | GENC\\nCC1_GENC3 | GENC\\nCC1_WPID | World Polygons\\nCOUNTRY1 | DoS Lists\\nCC2 | GENC\\nCC2_GENC3 | GENC\\nCC2_WPID | World Polygons\\nCOUNTRY2 | DoS Lists\\nLSIB_ID |   BASE\\nANTECIDS | BASE\\nPREVIDS | BASE\\nPARENTID | BASE\\nPARENTSEG | BASEThe core attributes listed above describe the boundary lines contained within the LSIB dataset.  Removal of core attributes from the dataset will change the meaning of the lines.  An attribute status of “Extension” represents a field containing data interoperability information.  Other attributes not listed above include “FID”, “Shape_length” and “Shape.” These are components of the shapefile format and do not form an intrinsic part of the LSIB.Core AttributesThe eight core attributes listed above contain unique information which, when combined with the line geometry, comprise the LSIB dataset.  These Core Attributes are further divided into Country Code and Name Fields and Descriptive Fields.County Code and Country Name Fields“CC1” and “CC2” fields are machine readable fields that contain political entity codes.  These are two-character codes derived from the Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes Standard (GENC), Edition 3 Update 18.  “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC3” fields contain the corresponding three-character GENC codes and are extension attributes discussed below.  The codes “Q2” or “QX2” denote a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with areas not contained within the GENC standard.The “COUNTRY1” and “COUNTRY2” fields contain the names of corresponding political entities.  These fields contain names approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) as incorporated in the ‘\"Independent States in the World\" and \"Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty\" lists maintained by the Department of State.  To ensure maximum compatibility, names are presented without diacritics and certain names are rendered using common cartographic abbreviations.  Names for lines associated with the code \"Q2\" are descriptive and not necessarily BGN-approved. Names rendered in all CAPITAL LETTERS denote independent states.   Names rendered in normal text represent dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, or are otherwise presented for the convenience of the user.Descriptive FieldsThe following text fields are a part of the core attributes of the LSIB dataset and do not update from external sources. They provide additional information about each of the lines and are as follows:\\nATTRIBUTE NAME | CONTAINS NULLS\\nRANK | No\\nSTATUS | No \\nLABEL | Yes\\nNOTES | YesNeither the \"RANK\" nor \"STATUS\" fields contain null values; the \"LABEL\" and \"NOTES\" fields do.\\nThe \"RANK\" field is a numeric expression of the \"STATUS\" field.  Combined with the line geometry, these fields encode the views of the United States Government on the political status of the boundary line.A value of “1” in the “RANK” field corresponds to an \"International Boundary\" value in the “STATUS” field.  Values of ”2” and “3” correspond to “Other Line of International Separation” and “Special Line,” respectively.The “LABEL” field contains required text to describe the line segment on all finished cartographic products, including but not limited to print and interactive maps.The “NOTES” field contains an explanation of special circumstances modifying the lines.  This information can pertain to the origins of the boundary lines, limitations regarding the purpose of the lines, or the original source of the line.Use of Core Attributes in Cartographic VisualizationSeveral of the Core Attributes provide information required for the proper cartographic representation of the LSIB dataset.  The cartographic usage of the LSIB requires a visual differentiation between the three categories of boundary lines.  Specifically, this differentiation must be between:\\n- International Boundaries (Rank 1);\\n- Other Lines of International Separation (Rank 2); and\\n- Special Lines (Rank 3).Rank 1 lines must be the most visually prominent.  Rank 2 lines must be less visually prominent than Rank 1 lines.  Rank 3 lines must be shown in a manner visually subordinate to Ranks 1 and 2.  Where scale permits, Rank 2 and 3 lines must be labeled in accordance with the “Label” field.  Data marked with a Rank 2 or 3 designation does not necessarily correspond to a disputed boundary.  Please consult the style files in the download package for examples of this depiction.The requirement to incorporate the contents of the \"LABEL\" field on cartographic products is scale dependent.  If a label is legible at the scale of a given static product, a proper use of this dataset would encourage the application of that label.  Using the contents of the \"COUNTRY1\" and \"COUNTRY2\" fields in the generation of a line segment label is not required.  The \"STATUS\" field contains the preferred description for the three LSIB line types when they are incorporated into a map legend but is otherwise not to be used for labeling.Use of the “CC1,” “CC1_GENC3,” “CC2,” “CC2_GENC3,” “RANK,” or “NOTES” fields for cartographic labeling purposes is prohibited.Extension AttributesCertain elements of the attributes within the LSIB dataset extend data functionality to make the data more interoperable or to provide clearer linkages to other datasets.The fields “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC” contain the corresponding three-character GENC code to the “CC1” and “CC2” attributes.  The code “QX2” is the three-character counterpart of the code “Q2,” which denotes a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with a geographic area not contained within the GENC standard.To allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and World Polygons dataset, the “CC1_WPID” and “CC2_WPID” fields contain a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), version 4, which provides a stable description of each geographic entity in a boundary pair relationship.  Each UUID corresponds to a geographic entity listed in the World Polygons dataset.  These fields allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and the overall World Polygons dataset.Five additional fields in the LSIB expand on the UUID concept and either describe features that have changed across space and time or indicate relationships between previous versions of the feature.The “LSIB_ID” attribute is a UUID value that defines a specific instance of a feature.  Any change to the feature in a lineset requires a new “LSIB_ID.”The “ANTECIDS,” or antecedent ID, is a UUID that references line geometries from which a given line is descended in time.  It is used when there is a feature that is entirely new, not when there is a new version of a previous feature.  This is generally used to reference countries that have dissolved.The “PREVIDS,” or Previous ID, is a UUID field that contains old versions of a line.  This is an additive field, that houses all Previous IDs.  A new version of a feature is defined by any change to the feature—either line geometry or attribute—but it is still conceptually the same feature.The “PARENTID” field introduces a concept of hierarchy into the data model.  This UUID field links related Rank 2 and Rank 3 lines to their corresponding Rank 1 line.  If two political entities share multiple boundary lines of different Rank or Status, this field contains an identifier that assembles all line segments together.The “PARENTSEG” field, which is a future-use field, contains information pertaining to constituent parts of a boundary line of the same rank or status.External Data SourcesCertain elements of the LSIB incorporate elements of other published data sources.

       "  'Description': 'The dataset, Survey-SR, provides the nutrient data for assessing dietary intakes from the national survey What We Eat In America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (WWEIA, NHANES). Historically, USDA databases have been used for national nutrition monitoring (1). Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the \"Primary Data Set\" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThe current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014,\\xa0is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods. These nutrient data will be used for assessing intake data from WWEIA, NHANES 2013-2014.\\xa0Nutrient profiles were added for\\xa0265\\xa0new foods and updated for about 500 foods from the version used for the previous survey (WWEIA, NHANES 2011-12).\\xa0\\xa0New foods added include mainly commercially processed foods\\xa0such as\\xa0several gluten-free products, milk substitutes, sauces and condiments such as sriracha, pesto and wasabi, Greek yogurt, breakfast cereals, low-sodium meat products, whole grain pastas and baked products, and several beverages including bottled tea and coffee, coconut water, malt beverages, hard cider, fruit-flavored drinks, fortified fruit juices and fruit and/or vegetable smoothies. Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample.

       "  'Description': 'The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Downloadable Data Collection from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go tohttps://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography.DWR was the steward for NHD and Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in California. We worked with other organizations to edit and improve NHD and WBD, using the business rules for California. California\\'s NHD improvements were sent to USGS for incorporation into the national database. The most up-to-date products are accessible from the USGS website. Please note that the California portion of the National Hydrography Dataset is appropriate for use at the 1:24,000 scale.For additional derivative products and resources, including the major features in geopackage format, please go to this page:https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-major-featuresArchives of previous statewide extracts of the NHD going back to 2018 may be found athttps://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/nhd-archive.In September 2022, USGS officially notified DWR that the NHD would become static as USGS resources will be devoted to the transition to the new 3D Hydrography Program (3DHP). 3DHP will consist of LiDAR-derived hydrography at a higher resolution than NHD. Upon completion, 3DHP data will be easier to maintain, based on a modern data model and architecture, and better meet the requirements of users that were documented in the Hydrography Requirements and Benefits Study (2016). The initial releases of 3DHP will be the NHD data cross-walked into the 3DHP data model. It will take several years for the 3DHP to be built out for California. Please refer to the resources on this page for more information.The FINAL,STATIC version of the National Hydrography Dataset for California was published for download by USGS on December 27, 2023. This dataset can no longer be edited by the state stewards.The first public release of the 3D Hydrography Program map service may be accessed athttps://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/3DHP_all/MapServer.Questions about the California stewardship of these datasets may be directed to nhd_stewardship@water.ca.gov.',\n",

ICOADS observations are assimilated into all major atmospheric, oceanic and coupled reanalyses, further widening its impact. R3, therefore includes changes designed to enable the effective exchange of information describing data quality between ICOADS, reanalysis centres, data set developers, scientists, and the public. These user-driven innovations include the assignment of a unique identifier (UID) to each marine report to enable tracing of observations, linking with reports and improved data sharing. Other revisions and extensions of the ICOADS' International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA) common data format incorporate new near-surface oceanographic data elements and cloud parameters. Many new input data sources have been assembled, and updates and improvements to existing data sources, or removal of erroneous data, made. Additionally, these data are offered in NetCDF with useful metadata added in global and variable attributes of each file to make the NetCDF self-contained.This dataset includes 2 versions of the official ICOADS Release 3 dataset: 1) the 'Total' product  (denoted by 'T' in the filename) which contains all duplicates and is used for verification and research purposes; and 2) 'Final' R3, with duplicates removed, where all reports have been compared for matching dates, id's and elements observed and the best duplicate retained as the final report.\",\n",

The RGTIHM was developed through an interagency effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) to provide a tool for analyzing the hydrologic system response to the historical (March 1940 through 2014) evolution of water use and potential changes in water supplies and demands in the Hatch Valley (also known as Rincon Valley in the study area) and Mesilla Basin (study area). Reclamation operates the Rio Grande Project (RGP) to store and deliver surface water for irrigation and municipal use within the study area and in the El Paso Valley south of the study area. The RGTIHM, using version 2 of the MODFLOW One-Water Hydrologic Flow Model, provides a tool to evaluate alternative management strategies, including conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater, and to support long-term planning and decision making for the RGP. The updated and recalibrated RGTIHM demonstrates a robust ability to simulate spatially and temporally variable measurements or estimates of hydraulic head, surface-water flows, agricultural pumping, RGP surface-water deliveries and canal waste, and decadal aquifer storage changes, with many improvements over the previous version of the model documented in Hanson and others (2020) (https://doi.org/10.3133/sir20195120).

Data were collected for cases and controls via a computer-assisted telephone information, and included information related to demographics, pre-existing health conditions, medication use, employment/occupation, personal hobbies, diet, and water use. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA cannot release personally identifiable information regarding living individuals, according to the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This dataset contains information about human research subjects. Because there is potential to identify individual participants and disclose personal information, either alone or in combination with other datasets, individual level data are not appropriate to post for public access. Restricted access may be granted to authorized persons by contacting the party listed. It can be accessed through the following means: Data that CDC collects or holds must be available for data sharing within a year after the data are evaluated for quality and shared with any partners in data collection activity.  Because NBDPS data contain PII, NBDPS data are not released publicly.  Instead, they are available via a special use agreement.  Qualified researchers can be granted access to NBDPS data for analysis through collaboration with one of the Centers for Birth Defects Research and Prevention.  The procedure for applying for access to NBDPS data can be found on the NBDPS Public Access Procedures web site:https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/nbdps-public-access-procedures.html. Format: This research was conducted with data collected by the CDC-sponsored National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS).
